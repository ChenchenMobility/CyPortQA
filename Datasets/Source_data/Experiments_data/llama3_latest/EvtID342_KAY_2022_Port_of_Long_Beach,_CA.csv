Answer: **36**",48
"Based on the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, I'll estimate the time to landfall.

Please provide me with the current cyclone position, latitude, longitude, and the projected track forecast cone coordinates (in decimal degrees).

Once I have this information, I can calculate the expected hours to landfall and respond with a single integer value. If no landfall is expected, I'll output 'None'.",60
