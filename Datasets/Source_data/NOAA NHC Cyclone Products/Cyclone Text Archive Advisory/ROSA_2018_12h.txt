DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rosa was
located near latitude 28.1 North, longitude 116.2 West.  Rosa is
moving toward the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue through Tuesday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Rosa will be near the coast of the
Baja California peninsula within the warning area later today and
then move across the peninsula into the northern Gulf of California
tonight.  Rosa's remnants are then expected to move across the
Desert Southwest on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Weakening is forecast through tonight while Rosa
approaches and moves over the northern Baja California peninsula.
Rosa is expected to become a remnant low over the southwestern
United States on Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rosa is expected to produce the following total rainfall
accumulations through Wednesday morning:

Baja California and northwestern Sonora: 3 to 6 inches, isolated
10 inches.

Central and Southern Arizona: 2 to 4 inches. Isolated 6 inch totals
are possible in the mountains of Central Arizona.

Rest of the Desert Southwest, Central Rockies, and Great Basin:
1 to 2 inches, isolated 4 inches.

These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash flooding.
Dangerous debris flows and landslides are also possible in
mountainous terrain.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are likely occuring over the coast
in portions of the warning area.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area by late this afternoon or tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Rosa will affect portions of the coasts
of southwestern Mexico, most of the west coast of the Baja
California peninsula, and southern California through Tuesday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
