"**Note:** The image provided is not available for me to analyze.

However, I can suggest a possible solution. If you could provide the actual Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center (NHC), I'd be happy to help you identify the coastal areas under Tropical Storm (TS) and Hurricane watch.

Please share the image, and I'll do my best to assist you!",None
"Based on the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, the coastal areas under Tropical Storm (TS) and Hurricane watch are:

Tampa to Englewood",None
Cocoa Beach FL to Flagler Beach FL,None in effect — no U.S. coastal watches issued
"West Palm Beach to Flagler Beach, Florida",None
Cuba to Key West Florida,None
Brownsville to Baffin Bay TX,None
"Based on the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, I can see that the coastal areas under Tropical Storm (TS) and Hurricane warning are:

Palm Bay to Englewood FL.

Heavy seas and rough seas are expected to impact coastal areas in Virginia.,Increased swells and rip currents may disrupt port and near-shore operations
Hazards: None.,Long-period swells and strong rip currents along Virginia beaches may affect small-craft operations.
Port Isabel,High surf and dangerous rip currents along adjacent Virginia beaches could affect port traffic
Port operations may be impacted by increased maritime traffic and vessel movements as ships take evasive action to avoid the storm's path.,"Long-period swells and higher seas could affect harbor approaches and pilot boarding areas beginning late Tuesday, creating hazardous navigation for small craft"
