DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Four 
was located near latitude 31.9 North, longitude 78.3 West. The 
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h) 
and this general motion is expected to continue for the next couple 
of days.  On the forecast track, the center of the tropical cyclone 
should make landfall along coast of South Carolina in the warning 
area later this evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight strengthening is expected today, and the depression is 
forecast to become a tropical storm before it makes landfall.  Rapid 
weakening is forecast after landfall occurs.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1013 mb (29.92 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Four can be found in the 
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header 
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at 
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages. 

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach
the coast within the warning area by late this afternoon, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
RAINFALL:  The depression could produce 1 to 3 inches of rainfall 
with locally higher amounts along the immediate coasts of Georgia 
and southern South Carolina. This region has been dry, limiting 
potential widespread flooding impacts, however, local flooding 
impacts, especially in urban areas along the southern South Carolina 
and Georgia coasts, cannot be ruled out at this time.
 
Farther inland, 1 to 2 inches of rainfall is possible across Upstate
South Carolina, the Piedmont of Georgia, and into northeastern
Alabama.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause 
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters 
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Port Royal Sound, SC to South Santee River, SC...1 to 3 ft 

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge 
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For 
information specific to your area, please see products issued by 
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
