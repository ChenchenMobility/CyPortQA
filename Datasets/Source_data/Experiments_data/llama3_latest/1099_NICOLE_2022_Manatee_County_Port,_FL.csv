"A numerical weather forecast!

After analyzing the text, I found the relevant information:

* The forecast for Manatee County Port, FL (GFMX 290N 850W) mentions:
	+ 34-kt wind arrival probability: ""3(4)""
	+ Cumulative probability within the next 5 days: not explicitly mentioned

However, I can extract some useful data. Since the probability is ""3(4)"", it implies that the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival within the next 4 hours (not days) is 30%. To estimate the cumulative probability within the next 5 days, we can assume a similar rate of increase in probability over time.

A rough estimate would be to multiply the 4-hour probability by approximately 10 (assuming a constant rate of increase). This gives us:

30% × 10 ≈ 300%

So, the estimated cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days is approximately **30%**.
