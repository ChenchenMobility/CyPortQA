Tornadoes.,Isolated tornadoes possible Friday into Friday night across eastern South Carolina.
"Tornadoes are possible overnight near the central South Carolina coast, increasing risk through Thursday and spreading into North Carolina, posing a threat to port operations.",Isolated tornadoes cannot be ruled out Friday; elevated seas and breakers will disrupt vessel movements and port operations.
"Isolated tornadoes are possible late tonight into Thursday morning mainly across central Florida, which may impact the port operations in South Carolina.",Isolated tornadoes possible in outer rainbands; temporary channel restrictions likely due to heavy rain and gusty winds
"Tornadoes are possible in the warned area, particularly near the coast where the tropical cyclone's outer rain bands interact with the land.",Rough seas and dangerous rip currents; possible short-lived tornadoes embedded in rain bands.
Flooding is expected in low-lying areas around the port due to heavy precipitation and potential flash flooding from the storm's outer rain bands.,Isolated tornadoes and very rough seas/strong coastal currents during Friday.
"Here's your answer:

Flooding may occur due to heavy precipitation affecting the Port of Charleston, SC.",Brief tornadoes/waterspouts are possible in outer rain bands as the center approaches and passes.
