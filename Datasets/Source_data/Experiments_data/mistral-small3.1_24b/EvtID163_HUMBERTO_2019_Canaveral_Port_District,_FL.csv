"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Canaveral Port District, FL within the next 5 days, we need to sum the probabilities listed for the relevant time periods for Canaveral Port District, FL (which is typically represented by Cape Canaveral or Patrick Air Force Base in weather data).

From the provided data, we look for the probabilities associated with 34-kt winds for Cape Canaveral:

- Day 1: 0%
- Day 2: 0%
- Day 3: 0%
- Day 4: 2%
- Day 5: 1%

Summing these probabilities:

0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 11 = 13

So, the cumulative probability is 13.",44%
