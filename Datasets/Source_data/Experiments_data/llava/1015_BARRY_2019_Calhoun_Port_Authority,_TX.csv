"The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot from a meteorological advisory or forecast track map. It depicts a map showing the path of a tropical cyclone, which is a type of storm system that forms over warm ocean waters.

In this image, there are two areas highlighted: a large area surrounding a small eye (the center of the storm), and an area to the south-southwest where a secondary weather event may be forming. The large area surrounding the small eye is likely the forecast path for the tropical cyclone. However, based on the information provided in the image, I cannot give you specific coordinates for the current eye or any other feature of the storm.

For accurate and up-to-date information about a tropical cyclone's path and intensity, it's recommended to refer to official sources such as the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Hurricane Center (NHC).
