"According to the text, the forecast for Port Freeport, TX is:

FREEPORT TX    34 1 15(16) 49(94)   3(97)   1(98)   1(99)   X(99)

To find the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival within the next 5 days, we need to look at the numbers in parentheses. The number 15 represents the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival within the next 16 hours (i.e., 0.15 or 15%).

Since we want to know the probability within the next 5 days, which is equivalent to 120 hours, we need to add up the probabilities for all the time intervals until we reach 120 hours.

The probability for the first interval is 0.15. For the next interval (16-31 hours), the probability is not given in the text, so we'll assume it's the same as the previous one: 0.15. The cumulative probability up to this point is therefore 2 x 0.15 = 0.30.

For the next two intervals (32-47 hours and 48-63 hours), the probabilities are not given in the text, so we'll assume they're both 0.49 (the value given for the 94th hour). The cumulative probability up to this point is therefore 0.30 + 2 x 0.49 = 1.28.

Finally, we need to add the probability for the last interval (64-120 hours), which is not given in the text. However, since we're looking for a cumulative probability within the next 5 days, it's reasonable to assume that the probability for this interval will be similar to the previous ones. Let's assume it's 0.49 as well.

The final cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Port Freeport, TX within the next 5 days is therefore:

1.28 + 0.49 = 1.77

So, the answer is: **1.77**",92%
