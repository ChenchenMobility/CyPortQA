"The question asks for the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at ""South Louisiana, LA, Port of"". However, there is no specific entry for ""South Louisiana, LA, Port of"" in the provided table. The closest and most representative entries for a port in South Louisiana are ""BURAS LA"", ""NEW ORLEANS LA"", ""GULFPORT MS"" (though Mississippi, it's on the Gulf Coast), and potentially locations like ""MORGAN CITY LA"" or ""NEW IBERIA LA"" which are inland but have port access.

Given the options and the ambiguity, and focusing on significant port activity, ""BURAS LA"" and ""NEW ORLEANS LA"" are the most direct references to ports in Louisiana.

For ""BURAS LA"", the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival between 00Z Sun and the forecast hour (which covers the next 5 days) is shown in the parentheses under the ""50 KT"" column for the later forecast hours. Looking at the cumulative probabilities (values in parentheses) for 50 KT for BURAS LA:
- (33) at forecast hour 48
- (36) at forecast hour 72

The question asks for the probability ""within the next 5 days"". The forecast table goes up to 120 hours, which is 5 days. The cumulative probability for ""BURAS LA"" for 50 KT at the last forecast hour (120 hours / 00Z FRI) is (36).

For ""NEW ORLEANS LA"", the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival between 00Z Sun and the forecast hour for 50 KT:
- (27) at forecast hour 48
- (32) at forecast hour 72

The cumulative probability for ""NEW ORLEANS LA"" for 50 KT at the last forecast hour (120 hours / 00Z FRI) is (32).

Since the question is asking for ""South Louisiana, LA, Port of"" and doesn't specify a particular port, and Buras is a significant port area, the highest cumulative probability for a port in South Louisiana at the end of the 5-day forecast period for 50-kt winds is for Buras.

However, if we interpret ""South Louisiana, LA, Port of"" as a general area that might include multiple ports and consider the highest probability among the listed Louisiana ports for 50 kt winds within the 5-day period, we look at the final cumulative probabilities.

Let's re-examine the question carefully: ""What is the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at South Louisiana, LA, Port of within the next 5 days?"". This phrasing implies a single value for the region. Without a specific named port for ""South Louisiana, LA, Port of"", we need to infer.

Looking at the cumulative probabilities for 50 KT for all Louisiana locations within the 5-day window (i.e., the last number in parentheses in the 50 KT row for each Louisiana location):
- BURAS LA: 36
- NEW ORLEANS LA: 32
- GFMX 280N 890W: 60 (This is a grid point, not a specific port, but it represents a location in South Louisiana)
- GFMX 280N 910W: 10
- BATON ROUGE LA: 17
- MORGAN CITY LA: 20
- ALEXANDRIA LA: 6
- LAFAYETTE LA: 10
- NEW IBERIA LA: 12
- GFMX 280N 930W: 3
- SHREVEPORT LA: X (less than 1)
- FORT POLK LA: 4
- LAKE CHARLES: 4
- CAMERON LA: 6
- JASPER TX: 14 (Texas, not Louisiana)
- KOUNTZE TX: 12 (Texas, not Louisiana)
- PORT ARTHUR TX: 12 (Texas, not Louisiana)
- GALVESTON TX: 10 (Texas, not Louisiana)
- HOUSTON TX: 5 (Texas, not Louisiana)
- FREEPORT TX: 5 (Texas, not Louisiana)
- GFMX 280N 950W: 6 (Texas, not Louisiana)
- HIGH ISLAND TX: 9 (Texas, not Louisiana)
- MATAGORDA TX: 4 (Texas, not Louisiana)
- PORT O CONNOR: 3 (Texas, not Louisiana)

The highest cumulative probability for 50-kt winds within the next 5 days for a Louisiana location is for GFMX 280N 890W, which is 60. If ""South Louisiana, LA, Port of"" is meant to encompass the area with the highest probability, then 60 would be the answer.

However, the question specifies ""Port of"". Among the listed Louisiana ports, Buras has the highest cumulative probability for 50 kt winds at 36. If we consider the highest of the specifically named Louisiana ports, it's 36. If we consider the highest of any Louisiana location, it's 60 from a grid point.

Let's consider the possibility that ""South Louisiana, LA, Port of"" is a general descriptor, and the most relevant specific port data might be the highest. Buras LA has a cumulative probability of 36 for 50kt winds within the next 5 days. New Orleans LA has 32.

Given the context of port operations, a specific port is usually referenced. Since ""South Louisiana, LA, Port of"" is not an exact match, and GFMX 280N 890W is a grid point and not a named port, we should look at the named ports. Between Buras LA (36) and New Orleans LA (32), Buras LA has the higher probability.
