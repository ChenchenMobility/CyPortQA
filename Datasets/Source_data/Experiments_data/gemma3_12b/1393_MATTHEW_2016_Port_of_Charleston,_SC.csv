"This is an incredibly complex and sprawling set of data! Let's break down how to attempt to answer your question, and the challenges involved.

**Understanding the Problem & Challenges**

* **Vast Data:** The text you provided is a huge amount of weather data. It looks like a combination of observations, forecasts, and possibly station metadata. The structure isn't consistent or easily parsed.
* **""Station"" Interpretation:**  Each line seems to represent a weather ""station,"" but identifying these stations (and where they are) would require a separate lookup table or key. The ""station names"" are a mix of locations and cryptic abbreviations like ""GFMX 290N 850W.""
* **Key Data Needed for the Question:** The specific data needed to answer your question – wind speed, probability – are scattered throughout these records, and require context (station, hour, etc.) to understand. The ""probability"" values are not clearly identified by label (e.g. Prob).
* **Time:** The ""hour"" referenced is unclear. There's no explicit time stamp.
* **Location:** The only known Location is ""station:port of Charleston, sc"".
* **Ambiguity:** Terms like ""probability"" aren't consistently used or labeled. It's possible some numbers represent something else entirely.
* **Model Interpretation:** “Model” reference requires access to the model parameters and structure for correct identification of what the numbers mean.

**Can an Exact Answer Be Obtained?**

Given the data format and the complexity of the question, it's **impossible** to provide a precise numerical answer without significantly more information and a robust data processing pipeline. I cannot connect the dots.

**General Approach if Data Were Structured**

If the data were in a usable, structured format (e.g., a CSV file with columns for station name, timestamp, wind speed, wind probability, etc.), the following steps would be required:

1. **Station Identification:**  Identify which records correspond to the ""port of Charleston, SC"". This would require a reference table or a way to decode the ""station names.""
2. **Data Extraction:** Extract the relevant wind speed and probability data for that station as one value).

"I am unable to provide a definitive answer to your question about the number of impacted commercial vessels at the Port of Charleston. Here's why:

*   **No Direct Information:** The provided text (the hurricane advisory) does not contain any specific data about port operations, vessel counts, or impact assessments for the Port of Charleston. It focuses on the hurricane's hazards and potential impacts in general terms.
*   **Complex Factors:** Predicting the impact on a port involves many factors not addressed in the advisory, such as:
    *   Specific vessel schedules and routes
    *   Port closure decisions
    *   Vessel diversion strategies
    *   Real-time weather.
