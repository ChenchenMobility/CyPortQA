Rip currents are a life-threatening hazard associated with this storm.,"Minor river-level rises possible downstream on the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, but no significant port disruption anticipated"
"Rip currents are likely to impact Ottawa Port District, IL, due to swells generated by the storm.",Minor river rises and localized flooding possible along the Illinois River channels near the port.
,Potential for localized river flooding along the Illinois River due to upstream heavy rainfall in the Mississippi Valley.
An isolated tornado is possible.,Brief lightning and localized visibility reductions in heavy rain showers could disrupt barge and lock operations.
,Brief spin-up tornadoes and localized flash flooding cannot be ruled out as the remnant circulation passes
,Potential navigation restrictions on the Illinois River if upstream rainfall raises river levels
Mudslides are a potential hazard.,Potential for temporary river-current rise and operational delays due to heavy rain and embedded thunderstorms; otherwise minimal tropical-cyclone hazards expected
