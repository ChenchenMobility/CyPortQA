"The wind speed probabilities for Kansas City Port Authority, MO are shown in the table provided. To determine how many hours remain until the 50-kt wind probability peaks, we need to identify when the cumulative probability reaches at least 1 percent.

Looking at the table, the cumulative probability for 50 kt at Kansas City Port Authority, MO starts with ""1( 3)"" in the 72-hour forecast and continues to increase with the subsequent time periods. Therefore, it appears that the 50-kt wind probability peaks within the first 72 hours of the forecast period.

To find out how many hours remain until the 50-kt wind probability peaks at Kansas City Port Authority, MO, we need to subtract the current time (12Z WED) from the starting time of the 72-hour forecast period (12Z THU). The starting time of the 72-hour forecast period is 12Z THU, which corresponds to 00Z THU + 12 hours. Therefore, the number of hours remaining until the 50-kt wind probability peaks at Kansas City Port Authority, MO is:

12Z WED - (00Z THU + 12 hours) = 30 hours

Therefore, there are 30 hours remaining until the 50-kt wind probability peaks at Kansas City Port Authority, MO.",N/A

It is not possible to determine the exact landfall location from this single image based solely on the storm's current speed and direction. Tropical storms are influenced by various atmospheric conditions and can change direction or intensity. Therefore, without additional information on the current speed and direction of Christine, it is not possible to confidently predict the exact landfall location.",southern Bay of Campeche coast now; central U.S. Gulf Coast (mainly Louisiana–Mississippi) by late weekend
