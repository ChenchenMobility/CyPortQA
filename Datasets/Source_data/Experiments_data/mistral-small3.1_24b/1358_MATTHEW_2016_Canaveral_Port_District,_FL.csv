"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Canaveral Port District, FL within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities listed for each day and sum them up. The probabilities for Canaveral Port District, FL (which corresponds to Cape Canaveral, FL in the data) are as follows:

- Day 1: 3%
- Day 2: 19%
- Day 3: 22%

"The cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Canaveral Port District, FL (which includes Cape Canaveral, Kennedy Space Center, and Patrick Space Force Base) within the next 5 days can be approximated by looking at the probabilities for Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center.

"The Canaveral Port District, FL, is likely represented by the ""ZAN"" or ""Zan"" label, but since it is not listed in the data, I will use the closest relevant location, which is ""ZAX"" (ZAX stands for ""Cape Canaveral, FL"").

The highest 34-kt wind probability for Cape Canaveral, FL (ZAX) is found in the 24-48 hours interval.

"The provided forecast data does not include information specific to Canaveral Port District, FL. However, the nearest relevant data points would be for locations such as Cape Canaveral or nearby areas. Since the question specifies Canaveral Port District, FL, and no direct data is available, we need to infer from the closest available data points.

Given the structure of the forecast data, we can infer that the highest probability for 34-kt winds would likely be in the interval that shows the highest cumulative probability for nearby locations. Typically, such probabilities increase as the storm approaches and then decrease as it moves away.

Without specific data for Canaveral Port District, we can generally infer that the highest wind probabilities would occur as the storm is closest to the area, which is often within the 24-48 hour interval.

Therefore, the answer is:
