"The data did not include any information about PortMiami, FL.  However, based on the general trend observed for other locations and the typical progression of tropical systems, the highest probability for tropical-storm-force winds (34 kt) would likely occur as the system approaches and makes landfall or passes nearby. Given the information provided and typical tropical cyclone behavior, the most likely time interval for the highest wind probability would be:

Possible Rip Currents,Brief lightning-producing squalls and reduced visibility during heavy showers could disrupt cargo handling and vessel movements
Rip Currents,Brief localized flooding of low-lying/poor-drainage areas from heavy downpours.
Rip currents and rough surf are expected.,Occasional lightning in rain bands; minor disruptions to small craft operations offshore
