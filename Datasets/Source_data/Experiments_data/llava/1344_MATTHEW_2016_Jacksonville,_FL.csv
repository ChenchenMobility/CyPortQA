The forecast indicates that the hurricane will continue to move northward near or over the coast of Georgia through tonight, near or over the coast of South Carolina later tonight and Saturday, and near the coast of southern North Carolina on Saturday night.

The advisory warns about sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher gusts, and tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 185 miles (295 km). The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches).

The storm surge will cause flooding in areas near the coast, including Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, to Edisto Beach, South Carolina, with water reaching 6 to 9 feet above ground level, and Edisto Beach, South Carolina to Cape Fear, North Carolina, with water reaching 5 to 7 feet above ground level.

The advisory also warns about rainfall of 8 to 12 inches over the Atlantic coast of the United States from eastern Georgia into eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia, with possible isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches. Tornadoes are also possible near the South Carolina coast for the remainder of tonight.

The next intermediate advisory is expected at 200 AM EDT, and the next complete advisory will be at 500 AM EDT. The advisory notes that there is a danger of life-threatening inundation during the next 36 hours along the Florida northeast coast, the Georgia coast, the South Carolina coast, and the North Carolina coast from the Volusia/Brevard county line, Florida, to Cape Fear, North Carolina.

The image also includes a table with various locations, including Jacksonville, FL, and their expected maximum sustained wind speeds in mph (km/h) over the next 48 hours.
