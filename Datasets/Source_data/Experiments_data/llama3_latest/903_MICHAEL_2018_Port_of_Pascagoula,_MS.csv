"Based on the provided forecast data, I can see that there is a probability of 34-kt winds at various points along the Gulf Coast. However, I cannot find any specific information about the Port of Pascagoula, MS.

Since the port's location is not specified in the forecast, I will assume it is somewhere along the Mississippi coast. Considering this, I would say that the probability of 34-kt winds at the Port of Pascagoula, MS reaching or exceeding 20% during the forecast period is:

The correct answer is D. 20 vessels or more.,B.
D. 20 vessels or more,B.
"The correct answer is B. 1-10 vessels.

According to the information provided in the text, the storm surge and hurricane-force winds are expected to cause significant impacts on the coast of Mississippi, including the Port of Pascagoula. The storm's track and intensity suggest that it will likely bring some commercial vessel traffic to a standstill or reduce the number of vessels able to operate safely.

Given the average daily vessel traffic at the port (4.11), it is reasonable to expect that 1-10 vessels may be impacted by the storm, with some possibly seeking shelter in safe harbors or anchoring offshore until the storm passes.",B.
