"Based on the provided forecast data, Beaumont, TX is not listed. However, the closest location with a similar name is **Port Arthur, TX**. Port Arthur, TX is near Beaumont, TX. If we assume that Port Arthur, TX is the closest location, here's how we can determine the answer:

Looking at the Port Arthur location within the text, the probabilities for different wind speeds rise above zero at different times. Based on the table of values presented, it can be inferred that the first time 34-kt winds are possible is at **0-24 hours**.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.",A.
"Based on the provided text, it's impossible to determine when the probability of 34-kt winds at Beaumont, TX rises above zero. The text contains a large amount of data related to wind probabilities at various locations, but there's no specific information about Beaumont, TX.

Therefore, the answer is **Cannot be determined**. However, given the multiple-choice format and lack of information, the best choice from the available options is **A. 0 hours**. This is the least incorrect since the text simply doesn't mention Beaumont.",B.

"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory explicitly mentions ""catastrophic and life-threatening flooding"" and indicates Harvey is expected to meander near the Texas coast for an extended period (through the weekend). Beaumont is a major port city on the Neches River, which is highly susceptible to flooding. Given the intensity of the predicted rainfall (15-35 inches) and the potential for prolonged flooding, a significant disruption to port operations and a large number of vessels stranded or delayed is highly likely. 20 vessels represents an extremely high impact and that is the most likely outcome given this storm.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The provided text focuses on rainfall, storm surge, and wind hazards. It doesn't give a direct number of vessels impacted. However, it describes a ""life-threatening and devastating"" situation with immense rainfall and storm surge. Given the scale of the predicted impacts, it is likely that the port of Beaumont (a major shipping hub) would experience significant disruption and delays, leading to a substantial number of vessels affected. The extreme conditions would almost certainly cause a disruption leading to at least 20 vessels impacted.",D.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Reasoning:**

The advisory indicates ""life-threatening storm surge and freshwater flooding expected."" It also mentions the storm will stall near the middle Texas coast, impacting Beaumont. A stalled, powerful hurricane will severely disrupt port operations. Given the advisory's dire warnings, it's highly probable that Beaumont would experience a significant disruption leading to a substantial number of vessels impacted, more than 20.",D.
,D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory indicates that Beaumont, TX is within the potential impact area for heavy rainfall and potential hurricane conditions. This will almost certainly cause port closures and disruptions to shipping. Given the significant rainfall predicted (10-20 inches), the disruption to shipping would be considerable, leading to a substantial number of vessels being impacted over the duration of the event.",D.
