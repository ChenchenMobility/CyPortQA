"The image you provided is a screenshot of a map showing the path and intensity of Hurricane Harvey, which has since dissipated. The current eye of a tropical cyclone would be represented by the center coordinates of the storm. Based on the information available in the image, it is not possible to determine the exact coordinates of the current eye of Tropical Cyclone Harvey. However, as a language model, I can provide some general information about tropical cyclones:

The eye of a tropical cyclone is the area near the center where winds are calmest and weather conditions are more organized. The size, position, and intensity of a hurricane's eye can vary widely depending on several factors, including the storm's overall size, the strength of the atmospheric pressure within the storm, and the amount of heat energy available to fuel the system.

In this particular image, there is no visible eye at the current time because Hurricane Harvey has since moved on and been absorbed into other weather systems. If you have a more recent map or are looking for information about an active tropical cyclone, I would be happy to provide further details based on that specific image.","26.7N, 96.0W"
