"The provided wind speed probability table does not contain any information for Virginia (VA). Therefore, it is impossible to determine when the probability of 34-kt winds at Virginia, VA, Port of rises above zero based on this data.

However, if we interpret the question as asking about the first time *any* location listed has a probability above zero for 34-kt winds, that would be the ""GFMX 280N 890W"" location with a probability of 3% in the ""0-12 hours"" time period (from 12Z FRI to 00Z SAT). This would correspond to the ""0-24 Hours"" option.

Given the constraint to answer with ONLY a choice and assuming the question implicitly refers to the *earliest* probability above zero in the table for *any* location:
