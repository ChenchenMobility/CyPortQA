Surf,Isolated tornado risk cannot be ruled out inland; potential river/urban flooding impacts port operations
"There are no additional hazards associated with the possible future storm at Wilmington, DE, excluding rainfall, wind, and storm surge.",Low-end risk of isolated brief tornadoes inland if remnants track nearby; possible minor river rises but no significant flooding forecast.
Tornadoes.,Localized river or urban flooding from persistent rain bands
Tornadoes are possible.,None
"No additional hazards are associated with the possible future storm at Wilmington, DE, excluding rainfall, wind, and storm surge.",Urban and small-stream flooding could disrupt terminal trucking and rail access
