"Based on Tropical Storm Ian's forecast track and potential impacts, no specific guidance is currently recommended for general vessel activity at Tampa Port Authority, FL, as the storm is expected to remain offshore. However, vessel operators should monitor updates from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and local authorities for any changes in the storm's trajectory or intensity that may affect the port's operations.","Vessels wishing to remain in port must obtain Captain-of-the-Port permission and provide a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia or Florida that cannot offload and depart at least 24 h before hazardous winds should seek an alternate port."
"Based on the information provided, there are no specific watch or warning issued for the Tampa Port Authority area, but Tropical Storm Ian's expected track suggests that hurricane conditions may be possible in the Cayman Islands by early Monday. Therefore, general vessel activity at Tampa Port Authority should proceed with caution and monitoring of the storm's progress, taking into account any advisories or updates from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) or local authorities.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must obtain Captain of the Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should divert to an alternate port.
"Based on the forecasted track and impacts of Tropical Storm Ian, it is recommended that all ocean-going and commercial vessels at Tampa Port Authority, FL take immediate action to depart or prepare for departure from the port area, as strong winds, heavy rainfall, and potential storm surge may pose significant risks to vessel safety.","Vessels wishing to remain in port must obtain Captain-of-the-Port permission and provide a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia or Florida that cannot offload and depart at least 24 h before hazardous winds should seek an alternate port."
"As Tropical Storm Ian is expected to strengthen and potentially impact the Tampa Bay area, I suggest that ocean-going and commercial vessels in or around Tampa Port Authority, FL take cautionary measures, including monitoring weather updates closely and preparing for potential storm-force winds and heavy rainfall. Vessels should consider adjusting their routes, anchoring locations, or delaying their departure if necessary to ensure safe navigation.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must obtain Captain of the Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should divert to an alternate port.
"Based on the current weather conditions and forecast, it appears that Ian will bring tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to the Tampa Bay area by Tuesday or Wednesday, posing a risk of flooding and storm surge impacts. As a result, operational guidance for port and facility operation at Tampa Port Authority, FL may suggest preparing for potential closures or restrictions on vessel traffic, securing loose outdoor objects, and taking measures to prevent flooding and damage from heavy rainfall and storm surge.",Ports and facilities are open to all commercial traffic and all transfer operations may continue while Condition X-RAY is in effect.
"Based on the current situation, no specific guidance is suggested for port and facility operation at Tampa Port Authority, FL, as Tropical Storm Ian is still in the Caribbean Sea and not expected to directly affect the port or surrounding area. However, it is recommended that the port and facilities monitor the storm's progress and potential impacts on the Gulf Coast, including the possibility of increased winds, rough seas, and heavy rainfall.",Ports and facilities are open to all commercial traffic and transfer operations may continue while Condition WHISKEY is in effect.
"Given the forecasted track of Tropical Storm Ian and its expected strengthening into a hurricane, it is likely that the Tampa Port Authority will issue a warning or advisory for tropical storm-force winds by the next operational guidance cycle (in 12 hours), urging vessels to take necessary precautions and consider delaying or modifying their operations.","Vessels wishing to remain in port must obtain Captain-of-the-Port permission and provide a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia or Florida that cannot offload and depart at least 24 h before hazardous winds should seek an alternate port."
"Based on the current situation of Tropical Storm Ian strengthening over the central Caribbean Sea, the most likely future operational guidance for general vessel activity at Tampa Port Authority, FL within the next 24 hours is a possible advisory or warning from the National Weather Service (NWS) or the U.S. Coast Guard regarding potential weather-related hazards, such as high winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas, which could impact port operations and vessel traffic.","Vessels wishing to remain in port must obtain Captain-of-the-Port permission and provide a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia or Florida that cannot offload and depart at least 24 h before hazardous winds should seek an alternate port."
"Based on the forecast, it is likely that there will be no significant impacts from Tropical Depression Nine on general vessel activity at Tampa Port Authority, FL within the next 12 hours.
