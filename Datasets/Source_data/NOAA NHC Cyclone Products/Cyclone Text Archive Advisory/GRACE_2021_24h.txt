DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Grace was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 18.8 North, longitude 80.9 West.  Grace is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A general westward to 
west-northwestward motion is expected for the next several days.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Grace will continue to move near 
or the Cayman Islands later this morning.  Grace is expected to 
make landfall in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico early Thursday, 
and move into the southwest Gulf of Mexico early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Grace is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane later 
today, with some additional strengthening possible prior to the 
center reaching the eastern Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center. Wind gusts to hurricane force have been reported 
on Grand Cayman.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter observations is 993 mb (29.32 inches).

Grace is expected to produce the following rainfall amounts:
 
Over Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, portions of the Yucatan Peninsula
and Vera Cruz state....4 to 8 inches of rain with isolated maximum
totals of 12 inches are expected through Friday night.  This heavy
rainfall could lead to flash and urban flooding, with mudslides
possible in Jamaica.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge could raise water levels as high as 1 to
3 ft above normal tide levels in portions of the Cayman Islands.
 
A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5

coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Grace will spread westward from Jamaica
to the Cayman Islands, the southern coast of Cuba, and the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
