Tornadoes are possible over coastal South Carolina.,Minor coastal rip-current risk on Gulf beaches
"No additional hazards are mentioned for Tampa Port Authority, FL, besides rainfall, wind, and storm surge.",Enhanced rip-current risk along Gulf beaches; minor operational delays from squalls.
Tornadoes may occur in coastal South Carolina and eastern North Carolina.,Increased rip-current risk in the Gulf may occur but no major operational hazards expected
Surf,Occasional lightning in squalls; choppy bay/near-shore seas could hamper small-craft movements
Surf conditions.,Brief reductions in visibility and increased lightning risk in squalls; potential vessel schedule disruptions due to precautionary routing around the peninsula.
Rip current conditions.,Rough bay/near-shore seas and higher than normal tides could briefly affect small-craft operations
Surf.,"Minimal – routine marine operations may see higher Atlantic swells, but Gulf waters near the port remain largely undisturbed."
"No additional hazards are mentioned for Tampa Port Authority, FL.",Choppy bays/seas and dangerous rip currents in the eastern Gulf could briefly disrupt vessel movements.
"No additional hazards are mentioned for Tampa Port Authority, FL.",Choppy seas in the approaches to Tampa Bay and occasional squalls could disrupt vessel scheduling even without a direct strike.
