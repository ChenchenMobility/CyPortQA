Rip current threat expected along eastern Texas Gulf Coast beaches due to swells generated by Marco's passage.,A brief tornado cannot be ruled out in outer rain bands.
"Tornadoes are possible in Beaumont, Texas, due to Marco's interaction with the Texas coast.",Dangerous rip currents along upper Texas coast
Isolated tornadoes.,Very rough seas and dangerous rip currents in approaches; brief tornado threat cannot be ruled out Tuesday
"Tornadoes are a possibility near Beaumont, TX, as Marco's outer rain bands interact with the local terrain.","Scattered power outages, localized river rises and reduced visibility; prolonged periods of heavy rain may disrupt terminal and roadway access."
Tropical Storm Marco.,Brief tornadoes in outer rainbands and temporary channel/ICW closures possible.
Isolated tornadoes could be possible if the system strengthens further or interacts with other weather systems.,Brief coastal flooding and hazardous seas could disrupt vessel traffic and cargo operations in the Sabine–Neches Waterway.
"Isolated tornadoes are possible within the warning area over eastern Texas, including Beaumont, as the system's outer circulation interacts with the surrounding atmosphere.",None identified beyond routine squalls and elevated seas in the approaches to Sabine Pass.
"Tornadoes are a potential hazard for Beaumont, Texas, as Tropical Depression Fourteen strengthens into a tropical storm and eventually a hurricane, producing an unstable atmosphere prone to tornado formation.",Brief marine squalls and higher seas in approach; possible navigation restrictions in the Sabine-Neches ship channel
"Tornadoes are a potential hazard for Beaumont, TX if the storm strengthens into a hurricane or tropical storm that produces a mesoscale circulation over land.",Brief port closure or traffic restrictions possible during peak winds; localized flooding in low-lying dock areas
