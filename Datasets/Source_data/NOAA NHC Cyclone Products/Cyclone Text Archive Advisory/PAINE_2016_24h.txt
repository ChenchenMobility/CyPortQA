DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Paine was located
near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 116.7 West. Paine is moving
toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn toward
the north is expected tonight, followed by a north-northeastward
turn and a reduction in forward speed Tuesday night.  On the
forecast track, the center of Paine is expected to approach the
northwest coast of the Baja California Tuesday night or early
Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is forecast during the next
day or so, and Paine is expected to weaken to a tropical storm by
Tuesday morning, and become a remnant low on Wednesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Hurricane Paine is expected to produce rainfall amounts
of 2 to 4 inches across the northern Baja California peninsula with
isolated storm total amounts of 6 inches through Wednesday.

Moisture in advance of Paine will help spread rains into portions
of southern California, Arizona, southern Utah, New Mexico, and
southwestern Colorado with localized maximum amounts of 1 to 2
inches possible, mainly over the favored higher terrain.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within a portion of
the warning area by Tuesday night.
