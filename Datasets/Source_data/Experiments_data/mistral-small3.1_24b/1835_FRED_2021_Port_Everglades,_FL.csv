"Based on the provided information, the port of Miami is expected to be affected by Tropical Depression Fred starting from Friday night into Saturday. The storm is expected to regain tropical storm strength as it nears the Florida Keys and south Florida. Given the storm's forecast track and intensity, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations may take up to 2 days to fully recover after the storm passes. This estimate considers the time needed for the storm to move through the area, for winds and seas to subside, and for port authorities to assess and repair any damage.

Answer: 2",None
"Based on the provided information, the port of Miami is expected to be affected by Tropical Depression Fred starting from Saturday, August 14, 2021. The storm is forecasted to move through the region and weaken gradually. Considering the typical recovery time for ports after a tropical storm, which includes assessing damage, clearing debris, and restoring operations, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations may take around 3 days to fully recover.
