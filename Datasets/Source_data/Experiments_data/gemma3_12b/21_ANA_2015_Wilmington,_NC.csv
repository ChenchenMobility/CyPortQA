"**D. 20 vessels or more**

Here's why:

*   **Storm Surge and Hazardous Conditions:** The advisory highlights ""life-threatening surf and rip currents"" and potential storm surge. These conditions would severely disrupt port operations and likely cause a significant number of vessels to seek safe harbor.
*   **Widespread Impact:** The advisory covers a wide area (Cape Hatteras to South Carolina), suggesting port closures and disruptions along a considerable stretch of the coastline.
*   **Wilmington's Importance:** Wilmington, NC is a significant port. A disruption of this magnitude would affect more than just a few vessels.",B.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory mentions ""rainfall accumulations of 1 to 3 inches, with isolated amounts of 5 inches, over eastern portions of North Carolina and South Carolina through Monday."" Wilmington, NC is in eastern NC and would likely experience significant rainfall. Heavy rainfall and potential storm surge would disrupt port operations. Given the estimated rainfall, it is probable that a significant number of vessels would be impacted over the entire event.",B.
