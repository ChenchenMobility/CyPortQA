DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bonnie was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near
latitude 31.0 North, longitude 79.5 West. Bonnie is currently
stationary. A motion toward the north-northwest is expected to begin
overnight, followed by a turn toward the north as the center of
Bonnie moves near the coast in the warning area on Sunday. A slow
northeastward motion near the central and northern coast of South
Carolina is expected Sunday night and Monday.

Data from the aircraft indicate that maximum sustained winds have
increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change
in strength is expected overnight. Some weakening is expected to
begin by late Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km),
mainly to the northwest of the center.

The latest estimated minimum central pressure based on data from
the aircraft is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Bonnie is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts around 6 inches from central
and eastern South Carolina to the Georgia border. Rainfall
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches are expected across southeastern
North Carolina.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area overnight or early Sunday.

STORM SURGE: Storm surge inundation of 1 to 2 feet above ground
level is possible within the tropical storm warning area during the
next high tide on Sunday morning.

SURF: Bonnie is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions along portions of the southeastern United States
coast through the weekend. Please consult products from your local
weather office.

TORNADOES: An isolated tornado will be possible late tonight and
early Sunday over the immediate South Carolina coastal region.
