D. 20 vessels or more,D.
A.,D.
"A. None.

**Explanation:**

The advisory focuses on the threat of a major hurricane and storm surge. It emphasizes evacuation and preparations. It *does not* mention specific numbers of commercial vessels impacted or any expectation of vessel activity. The focus is on safety and preparedness for a hazardous event, implying a cessation of normal operations like vessel traffic.",D.
A. None,D.
"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Reasoning:**

The advisory highlights significant hazards including:

*   **Hurricane conditions possible:** This indicates a high likelihood of port closures and vessel evacuations.
*   **Storm surge and flooding:** Severe flooding would make the port unusable.
*   **Dangerous surf and rip currents:** Impeding safe navigation and operations.

Given the severity of the predicted impacts, it is highly probable that a significant number of vessels would be impacted and/or seek safe harbor, exceeding 20 vessels.",D.
