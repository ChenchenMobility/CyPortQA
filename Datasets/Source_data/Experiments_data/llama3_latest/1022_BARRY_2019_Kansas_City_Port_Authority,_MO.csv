The answer is: A. None,A.
"The correct answer is A. None. Kansas City Port Authority is not a port that would be affected by Tropical Storm Barry, which was expected to impact the Gulf Coast and Mississippi Valley regions. Therefore, there would be no predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Kansas City Port Authority.",A.
None (A),A.
"The question does not provide any information about Kansas City Port Authority, MO or the event impacting it. The text only discusses Tropical Storm Barry in the Gulf Coast region. Therefore, the correct answer is A. None.",A.
"The correct answer is A. None. Kansas City Port Authority, MO is not located in the predicted impact area of the storm surge watch/warning graphic and tropical cyclone discussion, which suggests that no commercial vessels would be impacted at this port authority.",A.
"The answer is None. There is no Kansas City Port Authority in Missouri that handles commercial vessels. Kansas City has a river port on the Missouri River, but it is not a major cargo handling facility. The port primarily serves as a terminal for grain and other agricultural products.",A.
