"The Port of Pascagoula, MS is not listed in the provided data. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at that location based on the given information.",4%
0.13,5%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at the Port of Pascagoula, MS within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities listed for the relevant time periods. However, the provided data does not explicitly list Pascagoula, MS. Instead, we need to consider the nearest locations, which are Gulfport, MS, and Stennis, MS.

For Gulfport, MS:
- Day 1: 4%
- Day 2: 1%
- Day 3: 0%
- Day 4: 0%
- Day 5: 0%

For Stennis, MS:
- Day 1: 2%
- Day 2: 1%
- Day 3: 0%
- Day 4: 0%
- Day 5: 0%

Since Pascagoula is located between Gulfport and Stennis, we can take an average of the probabilities for these two locations to estimate the cumulative probability for Pascagoula.

Average probabilities:
- Day 1: (4% + 2%) / 2 = 3%
- Day 2: (1% + 1%) / 2 = 1.5%
- Day 3: (0% + 0%) / 2 = 0%
- Day 4: (0% + 0%) / 2 = 0%
- Day 5: (0% + 0%) / 2 = 0%

Cumulative probability:
3% + 1.5% + 0% + 0% + 0% = 4.5%

Since the question asks for a number, we round to the nearest whole number:

4",5%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at the Port of Pascagoula, MS within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities listed for each day and sum them up. However, the provided data does not include direct probabilities for the Port of Pascagoula, MS. Instead, it includes probabilities for nearby locations such as Mobile, AL, and Gulfport, MS.

Given that the Port of Pascagoula is geographically close to these locations, we can use the probabilities for Gulfport, MS, as a proxy. The probabilities for Gulfport, MS, are as follows:

- Day 1: 1%
- Day 2: 1%
- Day 3: 2%
- Day 4: 3%
- Day 5: 3%

Summing these probabilities:

1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 10

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at the Port of Pascagoula, MS within the next 5 days is 10.",3%

The nearest relevant data points are:
- GULFPORT MS: 0% (no data provided for 50-kt winds)
- MOBILE AL: 0% (no data provided for 50-kt winds)

Since the data for 50-kt winds is not provided for GULFPORT MS or MOBILE AL, we cannot directly calculate the cumulative probability for Port of Pascagoula, MS.

Given the lack of specific data, we cannot provide a number.",0%

"The provided data does not include specific information for the Port of Pascagoula, MS. However, it does include data for nearby locations such as Mobile, AL, and Gulfport, MS. To estimate the cumulative probability for the Port of Pascagoula, MS, we can consider the data for these nearby locations.

For Mobile, AL (34 kt: 2, 50 kt: X, 64 kt: X)
For Gulfport, MS (34 kt: 1, 50 kt: X, 64 kt: X)

Since the data for 50-kt winds is not provided for either location, we cannot directly determine the cumulative probability. However, if we assume that the probability for Pascagoula would be similar to these nearby locations, we can infer that the cumulative probability is likely very low or zero based on the available data.
