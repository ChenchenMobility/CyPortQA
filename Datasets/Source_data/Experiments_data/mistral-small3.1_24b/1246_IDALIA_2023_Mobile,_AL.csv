"The data provided does not include Mobile, AL. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given information.",C.
"The data provided does not include information for Mobile, AL. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given information. However, if we were to assume that Mobile, AL, should be included and follows a similar pattern to nearby locations like Pensacola, FL, or Gulfport, MS, we would look for the first non-zero probability in those locations.

Given the structure of the data, the first time the probability of 34-kt winds rises above zero for locations like Pensacola, FL, or Gulfport, MS, is within the 24-48 hours range.

Thus, the answer is:
