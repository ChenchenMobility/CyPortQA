Note: The gale force probability is not explicitly provided in the given text. Instead, it is estimated based on the fact that Zeta is currently a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h), and it is forecast to become a hurricane by early Tuesday. It is assumed that there will be some increase in wind speed as Zeta moves towards the central Gulf of Mexico. The probabilities are estimated based on this assumption, and they may vary depending on the actual evolution of the storm.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '4%'}"
