The cyclone will cause potential disruptions to port operations due to strong winds.,Long-period swells and dangerous rip currents for vessel approaches; isolated tornado risk in rainbands cannot be ruled out but is low this far west.
There are no additional hazards indicated on this track forecast cone for Hurricane Marco related to the Houston Port Authority.,Dangerous rip currents along Gulf beaches and possible brief coastal flooding at high tide
"The image shows a map of storm warnings and watches for Tropical Storm Marco. It includes information on wind speed, track forecast, public advisory, and potential hazards.",Elevated seas and rip currents along the upper Texas coast could disrupt vessel movements and cargo operations.
Flooding and disruptions to port operations due to storm conditions.,High surf and dangerous rip currents beginning late Monday; periodic squalls may temporarily reduce visibility for vessel movements.
"The image depicts an advisory related to Tropical Storm Marco. Additional hazards that might affect the Houston Port Authority in Texas exclude rainfall, wind, and storm surge. However, it is not possible for me to provide information about such potential hazards without further context or data sources.","Rough seas and elevated wave heights in the approaches to Houston Ship Channel beginning late Monday, posing restrictions for pilotage and cargo operations."
"Additional hazards associated with the possible future storm at Houston Port Authority, TX, include potential damage to infrastructure, disruption of maritime activities, and increased risks for marine vessels in the area.","Very rough seas (10–15 ft) in the approaches, possible brief tornadoes in outer rainbands; port operations may face berth closures and crane restrictions"
Flooding due to heavy rainfall can be expected in low-lying areas.,Periods of lightning in outer convection bands; otherwise none significant
