DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Colin
was located near latitude 23.6 North, longitude 87.8 West.
Colin is moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A
north-northeastward to northeastward motion at a faster forward
speed is expected tonight through Monday.  On this track, the center
of Colin is forecast to approach the coast of the Florida Big Bend
area Monday afternoon or evening.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast before Colin reaches the coast of
Florida.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL...Colin is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 5
inches with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches possible across the
northeastern Yucatan peninsula, western Cuba, western Florida,
eastern Georgia, and coastal areas of the Carolinas through
Tuesday.

STORM SURGE...The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters.  The water could reach the following heights above ground if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Indian Pass to Tampa Bay...1 to 3 ft with slightly higher amounts
possible in a few locations.
Tampa Bay south to Florida Bay...1 to 2 ft.

Localized coastal flooding and dangerous surf is possible along the
Florida East coast within the Tropical Storm Watch area.

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

WIND...Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
Gulf coast within the warning area by Monday afternoon, and the
Atlantic coast within the warning area by early Tuesday.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible along the Atlantic coast within the
watch area on Tuesday.
