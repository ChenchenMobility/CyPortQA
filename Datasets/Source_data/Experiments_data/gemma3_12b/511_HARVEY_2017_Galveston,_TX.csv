"Based on the provided text, there is no mention of the number of commercial vessels at Galveston, TX. The advisory focuses on the storm surge, wind, surf, and tornado potential. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the impacted number of commercial vessels.

Given the options and the lack of information, the most reasonable answer is **A. None**. This assumes the port is likely shut down due to the hurricane, so no vessels are impacted.",D.
,D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The provided text indicates a significant hurricane event (Harvey) is approaching the Texas coast, with a combination of dangerous storm surge, heavy rainfall, and hurricane-force winds. Given the severe weather conditions, it's highly probable that commercial vessel traffic at Galveston would be significantly disrupted, resulting in an increased number of vessels present to avoid the storm, or due to delays caused by the event. Even a partial disruption would likely result in a considerably higher number than the average daily traffic.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The provided text highlights that Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 10 to 15 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches over the Texas coast and southwest Louisiana through next Wednesday, with heavy rainfall beginning Friday. The forecast is for hurricane conditions within the hurricane watch area late Friday or Friday night, and the storm surge will impact Port Mansfield to High Island. These conditions would significantly disrupt port operations. With an average of 45 vessels daily, the disruption caused by such a storm would likely impact 20 or more vessels.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more.

**Explanation:**

The provided text doesn's explicitly provide the number of affected commercial vessels. However, it does state that there is a potential for ""hurricane conditions"" and ""tropical storm conditions"" that could lead to port closures and disruptions. Given the predicted heavy rainfall, potential for storm surge, and the overall severity of the event, it's reasonable to assume that a significant number of vessels would be impacted. The average daily number of vessels at Galveston (45.18862184) makes it unlikely that fewer than 20 would be affected.",D.
