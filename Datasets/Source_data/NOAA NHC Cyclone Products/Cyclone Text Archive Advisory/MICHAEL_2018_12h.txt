DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Michael was
located near latitude 27.7 North, longitude 86.6 West. Michael is
moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A northward motion
is expected this morning, followed by a northeastward motion later
today and Thursday. On the forecast track, the center of Michael
will move across the northeastern Gulf of Mexico this morning.  The
center of Michael's eye is then expected to move inland over the
Florida Panhandle or Florida Big Bend area later today, move
northeastward across the southeastern United States tonight
and Thursday, and then move off the Mid-Atlantic coast away from the
United States on Friday.

Data from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 130 mph
(210 km/h) with higher gusts.  Michael is now a category 4 hurricane
on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional
strengthening is possible today before Michael makes landfall in the
Florida Panhandle or the Florida Big Bend area.  Weakening is
expected after landfall as Michael moves across the southeastern
United States.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).

The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane
Hunter data is 945 mb (27.91 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water has the
potential to reach the following heights above ground if peak surge
occurs at the time of high tide...

Mexico Beach FL to Keaton Beach FL...9-13 ft
Okaloosa/Walton County Line FL to Mexico Beach FL...6-9 ft
Keaton Beach FL to Cedar Key FL...6-9 ft
Cedar Key FL to Chassahowitzka FL...4-6 ft
Chassahowitzka to Anna Maria Island FL including Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Alabama/Florida border to Okaloosa/Walton County Line FL...2-4 ft

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area along the U.S. Gulf Coast today, with tropical storm
conditions expected during the next several hours.  Hurricane
conditions will also spread well inland across portions of the
Florida Panhandle, southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia.

Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area this morning, and are possible within the tropical storm watch
area by that time.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the
hurricane watch area today.

Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along
the southeast U.S. coast later today, and possible in the watch
area by tonight.

RAINFALL:  Michael is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Friday...

Florida Panhandle and Big Bend, southeast Alabama, and portions of
southwest and central Georgia...4 to 8 inches, with isolated maximum
amounts of 12 inches. This rainfall could lead to life threatening
flash floods.

The remainder of Georgia, the Carolinas, and southern Virginia...3
to 6 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches. This
rainfall could lead to life-threatening flash floods.

Florida Peninsula, eastern Mid Atlantic, southern New England
coast...1-3 inches.

SURF:  Swells generated by Michael are affecting the coasts of the
eastern and northern Gulf of Mexico, and will spread to portions of
the northwestern and western Gulf of Mexico coast during the next
day or so.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

TORNADOES:  The threat for tornadoes will increase today into over
parts of the Florida Panhandle, the northern Florida Peninsula, and
southern Georgia.
