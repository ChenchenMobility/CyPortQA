"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory mentions several factors that would significantly disrupt port operations:

*   **Storm Surge:** A storm surge warning is in effect for the area including Virginia, VA. This would likely halt vessel operations to prevent damage and ensure safety.
*   **High Winds:** Tropical storm and potentially hurricane-force winds would make navigation and loading/unloading extremely hazardous.
*   **Rainfall:** Significant rainfall would further impede operations and visibility.
*   **Overall Disruption:** The advisory describes a widespread impact area with multiple warnings and watches, indicating a high likelihood of port closure or severe operational limitations.

Given the severity of these conditions and the average daily vessel count, it's reasonable to expect a substantial number of vessels to be affected, leading to a situation where 20 or more vessels would be impacted over the duration of the event.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory indicates tropical storm conditions are expected to impact the area through Saturday. Given the expected conditions (storm surge, high winds, rainfall), port operations would likely be significantly disrupted, leading to a substantial number of vessels seeking shelter or delaying entry/exit. The advisory highlights a wide-ranging impact zone, and while a precise number of vessels isn't given, the potential for disruption suggests a significant impact beyond a few isolated incidents.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The forecast discussion indicates ""tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the warning area in North Carolina on Friday, and spread northward Friday night and Saturday."" The warning area includes Virginia. Given the severity of the storm surge warning and tropical storm warnings extending to Virginia, it's highly probable that commercial vessel operations would be significantly disrupted. Given the average daily vessel traffic is 17.58411926, and disruptions are expected on Friday night and Saturday, and potentially lingering impacts, the most reasonable estimate is that 20 or more vessels would be impacted.",D.
