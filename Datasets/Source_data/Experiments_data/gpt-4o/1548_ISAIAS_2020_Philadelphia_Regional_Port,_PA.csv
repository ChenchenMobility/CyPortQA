"Tornadoes are possible at Philadelphia Regional Port, PA.",A few tornadoes possible Tuesday; hazardous seas and strong rip currents along the nearby New Jersey/Delaware coasts; brief interruptions to marine traffic on the Delaware River due to strong currents and rising water.
Surf and tornadoes.,Isolated tornadoes in outer rain bands; dangerous rip currents and elevated river levels that could hinder vessel traffic and cargo handling.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Increased river levels and hazardous marine/harbor conditions; embedded short-lived tornado threat cannot be ruled out.
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Dangerous rip currents and elevated waves may restrict vessel movements at entrance channels; brief river flooding on smaller tributaries possible
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,"Brief river flooding on tributaries, dangerous rip currents along nearby New Jersey and Delaware beaches"
Surf and rip current conditions.,High tributary currents and elevated Delaware River levels may hamper vessel handling; brief visibility reductions in squalls; possible schedule disruption due to precautionary port readiness measures
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,"Brief reduced visibility in squalls, elevated river levels, and possible logistical delays due to regional roadway flooding"
Surf and rip current conditions.,Potential river rise and debris flow affecting terminal operations due to upstream rainfall
Swells and rip currents.,"Very rough Delaware River conditions, strong currents, and elevated river stages could interrupt cargo handling and vessel movements"
"Swells and rip currents could pose hazards at Philadelphia Regional Port, PA.",Indirect impacts such as upstream cargo delays from Caribbean/Florida ports may occur before any direct weather reaches Philadelphia
