"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Port Everglades, FL within the next 5 days, we need to sum the probabilities provided for each day.

From the data:
- Day 1: 0 (since it is not listed)
- Day 2: 0 (since it is not listed)
- Day 3: 0 (since it is not listed)
- Day 4: 0 (since it is not listed)
- Day 5: 0 (since it is not listed)

Since Port Everglades, FL is not listed in the data, we cannot provide a cumulative probability for this specific location. However, if we were to consider a nearby location such as Fort Lauderdale, we would sum the probabilities for that location.

For Fort Lauderdale:
- Day 1: 0
- Day 2: 0
- Day 3: 0
- Day 4: 0
- Day 5: 0

Since the data does not provide probabilities for Port Everglades, FL, we cannot calculate the cumulative probability for this location. If you need the probability for a different location, please provide the specific location from the list.",10
