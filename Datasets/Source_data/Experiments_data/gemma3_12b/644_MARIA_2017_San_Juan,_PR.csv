"Okay, let's break down the request and extract the information needed to answer.

**Understanding the Request**

The text provides a table of forecasted wind probabilities for various locations. The specific question is:

*   ""What is the probability of winds exceeding 34 knots at San Juan, Puerto Rico?""

**Extracting the Relevant Data**

Looking at the table, we need to find the row corresponding to ""San Juan"" (which is listed as ""San Juan, PR"").  We are looking for the probability of winds exceeding 34 knots.

*   **34 knots:** The table shows the forecast data, specifically regarding 34 knots.
*   **San Juan, PR:** The location for which we want the probability.

**Analyzing the Data**

Here's how the table looks:

```
San Juan, PR    34  X   X( X)   2( 2)   8( 8)  53(63)   16(79)   2(81)
```

From this, we can infer that the answer from the table is 2.

**Therefore, the answer is 2.**",D.

"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Maria's Impact:** The advisory states Maria is expected to impact the Leeward Islands, including Puerto Rico (where San Juan is located), with hurricane conditions.
*   **Timeframe:** The advisory covers a period where impacts are expected (late Monday and Monday night, extending into Tuesday and Tuesday night).
*   **Disruption:** Hurricane conditions would severely disrupt port operations, preventing vessels from entering or leaving.
*   **Daily Average:** The given average of 11.75 vessels per day means a significant number of vessels are typically present.

Given the severity of the predicted hurricane conditions, it's reasonable to assume a large number of vessels would be impacted, and unable to operate at the port.

Therefore, the most logical answer is: **D. 20 vessels or more**",D.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Reasoning:**

The advisory mentions ""hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area by Tuesday,"" and ""tropical storm conditions possible in the tropical storm watch area Monday or Monday night."" This indicates a significant weather event impacting San Juan, Puerto Rico. Considering the average daily vessel count and the potential for disruption, it is highly probable that a larger than normal number of vessels will be impacted, leading to 20 or more vessels being affected.",D.
