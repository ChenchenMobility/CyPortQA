"The forecast data is presented in a format that does not lend itself to easily extracting information on the timing of peak wind probabilities. However, I can suggest an alternative approach.

You could analyze the forecast data for each location and look for instances where the 34-kt wind probability increases over time. For Lake Charles Harbor District, LA, you might find that the peak wind probability is expected around day 3 or 4 (depending on the specific forecast model used).

To answer your question more accurately, I would need to access additional data or information about the timing of the peak wind probabilities for each location. If you provide me with a different source or a larger dataset, I may be able to help you find the correct answer.
