"Manatee County Port, FL is not listed in the provided table. Based on proximity, the closest listed locations are Tampa and St. Petersburg, FL. Since they are not listed either, we need to consider the general trend of the probabilities for other Florida locations. Given that the probabilities drop significantly after the initial 12-24 hour window for other locations, the highest probability for Manatee County Port, FL would likely be within the first 24 hours. Therefore, the most likely interval is:
