DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Arthur was
located by an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft near 
latitude 29.4 North, longitude 77.7 West. Arthur is moving toward 
the north-northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h). A motion toward the
north-northeast or northeast is expected tonight and Sunday. After 
that time, a faster northeastward motion is expected on Monday. On 
the forecast track, Arthur will remain well offshore the east coast 
of Florida and Georgia tonight and Sunday, and then move near or 
east of the coast of North Carolina on Monday.
 
Data from the reconnaissance aircraft indicate that maximum 
sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 48 
hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure based on reports from the 
reconnaissance aircraft is estimated to be 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area on Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Arthur is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches over the central and northwest
Bahamas, and generally less than 1 inch over south Florida through
tonight.  Arthur is also expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches over coastal North Carolina Sunday
night and Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Arthur are affecting portions of
the east coast of central and northern Florida.  These swells are
expected to spread northward during the next few days, and could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much
of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
