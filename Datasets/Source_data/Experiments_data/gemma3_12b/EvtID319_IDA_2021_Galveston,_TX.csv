**Explanation:**

The text does not discuss impact to Galveston, TX, or commercial vessels specifically. It focuses on storm surge, wind, rainfall, and potential tornadoes impacting areas further west and south. Therefore, the most logical answer is that no vessels are directly mentioned as impacted.",A.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The text highlights potential impacts including ""dangerous surf and rip current conditions"" reaching the Gulf Coast, including Galveston, starting Saturday night/Sunday. This strongly suggests disruptions to port operations and potential delays or avoidance of the port by commercial vessels. Given the potential for severe weather, it's highly probable that a significant number of vessels would seek to avoid the Galveston area, or be delayed. Therefore, option D is the most logical choice.",A.
