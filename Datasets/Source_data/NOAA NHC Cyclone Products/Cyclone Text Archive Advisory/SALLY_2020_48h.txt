DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sally was 
located near latitude 28.4 North, longitude 87.4 West. Sally is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  This general 
motion is expected today, followed by a decrease in forward speed 
and a turn to the northwest tonight and a northward turn sometime on 
Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Sally will move over 
the north-central Gulf of Mexico today, approach southeastern 
Louisiana this afternoon, and make landfall in the hurricane warning 
area on Tuesday. Afterward, Sally is expected to move slowly 
north-northeastward near the northern Gulf Coast through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts. Strengthening is expected over the next day or
so, and Sally is forecast to become a hurricane by tonight, with
additional strengthening possible before the center crosses the
northern Gulf Coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.  NOAA buoy 42039, located about 130 miles (215 km)
south-southeast of Pensacola, Florida, recently reported peak
sustained winds of 49 mph (79 km/h) and a gust to 58 mph (94 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sally can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC,
and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of the Mississippi River to Ocean Springs including Lake
Borgne...7-11 ft
Ocean Springs to MS/AL Border...5-8 ft
MS/AL Border to AL/FL Border including Mobile Bay...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...4-6 ft
Port Fourchon to Mouth of the Mississippi River...3-5 ft
AL/FL Border to Navarre including Pensacola Bay...2-4 ft
Navarre to Chassahowitzka including Choctawhatchee Bay and Saint
Andrew Bay...1-3 ft
Burns Point to Port Fourchon...1-3 ft
 
Overtopping of local levees outside of the Hurricane and Storm
Damage Risk Reduction System is possible where local inundation
values may be higher than those shown above.
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
damaging waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area starting late today. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area during the next few hours, and are
expected within the warning area beginning this morning.
 
RAINFALL:  Sally is expected to be a slow-moving system as it
approaches land producing 8 to 16 inches of rainfall with isolated
amounts of 24 inches over portions of the central Gulf Coast from
the western Florida Panhandle to far southeast Louisiana through the
middle of the week. Life-threatening flash flooding is possible. In
addition, this rainfall will likely lead to widespread minor to
isolated major flooding on area rivers.
 
Sally is forecast to move farther inland early Wednesday and track
into the Southeast with rainfall of 6 to 12 inches possible across
portions of inland southeast Mississippi and Alabama. Significant
flash and urban flooding is likely, as well as widespread minor to
moderate flooding on some rivers.
 
Further heavy rain is then anticipated across portions of eastern
Tennessee, northern Georgia and western North Carolina Thursday into
Friday.  Flash, urban, and minor river flooding is possible across
this region.
 
Outer bands of Sally are expected to produce additional rainfall of
1 to 3 inches across the Florida peninsula today. This rainfall may
produce flash and urban flooding and prolong high flows and ongoing
minor flooding on rivers across central Florida.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two may occur this afternoon through
Tuesday over coastal areas of the Florida Panhandle, Mississippi,
Alabama, and extreme southeastern Louisiana.
 
SURF:  Swells from Sally will continue to affect areas from the 
west coast of the Florida peninsula westward through the coast of 
southeastern Louisiana during the next couple of days. These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
