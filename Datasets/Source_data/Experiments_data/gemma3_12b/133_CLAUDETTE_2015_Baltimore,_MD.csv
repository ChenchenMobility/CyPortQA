Okay, here's an analysis based on the provided documents. I'm acting as a cyclone and port operations analyst.  I've broken it down into sections: **Summary of Current Situation**, **Forecast Impacts**, **Port Operations Implications**, and **Recommendations**.

**1. Summary of Current Situation (as of 1100 AM AST, July 14, 2015):**

*   **Cyclone:** Tropical Storm Claudette.
*   **Location:** Near Latitude 40.1 N, Longitude 63.3 W (0900 UTC)  - approximately 270 miles South of Sable Island. It has since moved slightly North: Latitude 40.1N, Longitude 63.3W at 11:00 AST.
*   **Winds:** Max Sustained Winds near 45 mph (40 knots). Moving Northeast at 20 mph. It has since slowed to 25mph.
*   **Status:** Weakening and expected to become post-tropical tonight.
*   **Warnings:** Currently, there are no watches or warnings.

**2. Forecast Impacts:**

*   **Track:** The track forecast cone (from the first image) shows Claudette moving generally northeastward towards Newfoundland.  It is expected to pass relatively close to Cape Race, Newfoundland, and Ile St. Pierre, before moving eastward.
*   **Wind Probability Table (most critical for my analysis):** The wind probability table details the chance of experiencing sustained winds of 34 kt (39 mph), 50 kt (58 mph), and 64 kt (74 mph) at specific locations over the next 5 days.
    *   **Significant Risks (High Probability):**
        *   **Sable Island:** Very high probability (29% - 30%) of sustained winds >= 34 kt between 06Z Tue and 18Z Tue.
        *   **Ile St. Pierre:** Moderate probability (4% to 23%) of winds >= 34 kt between 06Z Tue and 18Z Tue.
        *   **Burgos and Sydney NS** have moderate chances of winds exceeding 34kts in the near future.
    *   **Lower, but still relevant risks:**  There are some probabilities for 50 kt winds, particularly at Sable Island, though these are lower than the chance of 34 kt winds.
    *   **64 kt probabilities:** Very low (X) – indicating a minimal chance.
*   **Public Advisory:**  Confirms the weakening trend and expected transition to a post-tropical system.  This usually means less organized winds but still potential for heavy rain and potentially hazardous seas.

**3. Port Operations Implications:**

Given the projected track and the probability forecasts, here's how Claudette could impact port operations:

*   **Sable Island:**  The highest risk area.  Even moderate winds (34 kt/39 mph) can cause delays due to increased wave action and potential for small craft advisories.  Higher probabilities would require more substantial port closures.
*   **Cape Race, Ile St. Pierre, Burgos, Sydney NS:**  Potential for moderate disruptions.  Expect vessel delays, particularly for smaller vessels and those engaged in cargo handling.  Shore-side operations (trucking, loading/unloading) may be affected by rain and potentially gusty winds.
*   **Coastal Newfoundland and Nova Scotia (generally):** Expect increased wave action and choppy seas, which can impede vessel movement and make cargo handling more challenging.
*   **Post-Tropical Transition:** The shift to a post-tropical system might reduce wind speed, but can still lead to increased wave heights due to the large fetch of wind over the ocean.

**4. Recommendations (as a cyclone and port operations analyst):**

*   **Immediate Actions:**
    *   **Monitor Closely:** Continue monitoring the storm’s track and intensity via the National Hurricane Center advisories.
    *   **Communicate:** Alert all stakeholders (shipping lines, port operators, cargo handlers, trucking companies) about the potential for disruptions.
    *   **Secure Loose Cargo:** Ensure all loose cargo and equipment are properly secured at ports and terminals.
*   **Contingency Planning (depending on the intensity of the system):**
    *   **Port Closures:**  Prepare for the potential need to temporarily close ports, particularly in areas with a high probability of strong winds.  Develop a clear communication plan for announcing closures and reopening.
    *   **Vessel Diversions:**  Be prepared to divert vessels away from potentially affected areas.
    *   **Shore-side Operations:**  Plan for delays and potential closures of shore-side operations.
    *   **Backup Power:** Ensure backup power is available for critical port infrastructure (lights, communication systems, cranes).
*   **Longer-term:** Review and update port contingency plans to incorporate lessons learned from this event and to address the evolving risks associated with tropical cyclones.
