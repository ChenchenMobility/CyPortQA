"Based on the information provided, it appears that Tropical Storm Jerry is expected to pass near Bermuda and bring tropical storm conditions to the area. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts that the storm will produce 1 to 3 inches of rainfall across Bermuda through Wednesday.

To estimate the impact on port operations and freight recovery, I would consider factors such as the severity of the storm's effects, the extent of damage or disruption caused by high winds and heavy rainfall, and the potential for flooding or other hazards.

Given these factors, I estimate that it may take around **3-5 days** for the port to recover from the effects of Tropical Storm Jerry.",5.0
