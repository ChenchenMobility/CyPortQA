"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory highlights significant storm surge and wind impacts along the Gulf Coast, including Mobile, AL. Given the severity of the predicted conditions (6-9 ft storm surge), port operations like Mobile would likely be suspended or severely curtailed. This would directly affect the number of commercial vessels able to be present or operate. Given the provided average daily vessel count, it’s reasonable to assume that well over 20 vessels would be impacted given the conditions forecast and likely suspension of normal operations.",B.
