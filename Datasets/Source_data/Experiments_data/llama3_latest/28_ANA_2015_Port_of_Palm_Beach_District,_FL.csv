"According to the Future Wind Probability Table from National Hurricane Center, for the Port of Palm Beach District, FL, the 34-kt wind probability is:

MYRTLE BEACH   34 27  11(38)   5(43)   4(47)   5(52)   1(53)   1(54)

So, the answer is: **54**",72
"Based on the Future Wind Probability Table from National Hurricane Center, for the location ""MYRTLE BEACH"", the cumulative probability for 34 kt winds is 27% by hour 38, then increases to 43% by hour 47, and finally reaches its peak at 52%.
