"A nice piece of text!

After analyzing the text, I found that there's no specific mention of Wilmington, NC or its predicted peak impact time.

However, if you're interested in knowing when Ian is expected to make landfall in Florida, which might affect freight at ports like Wilmington, NC, according to the text:

""...Ian will then move near or over western Cuba Monday night and early Tuesday and emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.""

So, based on this information, I'd estimate that the predicted peak impact time would be around 26-27 September (02-03 October in DD-MM-YYYY format). Keep in mind that this is just an educated guess, as there's no explicit mention of Wilmington, NC or its specific peak impact time.",None
