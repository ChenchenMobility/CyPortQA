"Based on the provided National Hurricane Center advisories and graphics for Tropical Storm Elsa, we need to estimate the impact on commercial vessels at Port Everglades.

Here's the analysis:

*   **Port Everglades Location:** Port Everglades is located in South Florida, near Fort Lauderdale.
*   **Elsa's Forecast Track:** The forecast indicates Elsa will pass near the Florida Keys early Tuesday and then near or over portions of the west coast of Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday. While it's not directly forecast to make landfall *at* Port Everglades on the east coast, the storm's proximity and the expansion of tropical storm-force winds are significant.
*   **Wind Speed Probabilities Graphic:** This graphic shows a high probability (over 70%) of tropical-storm-force winds in the vicinity of Port Everglades starting on Monday and extending into Tuesday.
*   **Wind Speed Probability Table:** Looking at Fort Lauderdale, the table shows:
    *   34 kt (39 mph) probabilities: X (less than 1%) at 18Z Sun, X(X) at 06Z Mon, X(X) at 18Z Mon, X(X) at 06Z Tue, X(X) at 18Z Tue, X(X) at 18Z Wed, X(X) at 18Z Thu. This indicates very low probabilities for sustained winds reaching tropical storm strength.
*   **Cyclone Public Advisory:** The advisory states that Elsa is expected to move near or over portions of the west coast of Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday. It also notes that tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area in the Florida Keys late Monday and could be possible in the watch area along the west coast of Florida beginning Monday night. It also mentions that a couple of tornadoes are possible across southern Florida Monday afternoon and Monday night into Tuesday.

**Interpretation for Port Operations:**

Given that Elsa is forecast to track across the west coast of Florida, and the probabilities of tropical-storm-force winds are relatively low at Port Everglades (east coast), it's unlikely that Port Everglades will experience sustained tropical storm-force winds for an extended period. However, tropical storm-force winds extending outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from the center suggest some impact is possible, especially with the potential for gusty winds and tornadoes.

Port operations typically cease or significantly reduce activity when tropical storm-force winds are imminent. If Port Everglades experiences less than tropical storm-force conditions for most of the event, a smaller number of vessels might be impacted by delays or port closures.

Let's consider the daily average of 12.218 vessels.

*   **No Impact (A):** Unlikely, as there's a possibility of some gusty winds and potential disruptions due to the storm's proximity.
*   **1-10 vessels (B):** This range is plausible if the port experiences a brief closure or partial suspension of operations due to the approaching storm, or if some vessels are delayed.
*   **10-20 vessels (C):** This would imply a more significant disruption, potentially a full closure for a day or two, affecting a substantial portion of the daily traffic.
*   **20 vessels or more (D):** This would suggest a prolonged closure or severe impact, which doesn't seem likely given the current track forecast for Port Everglades.

Considering the forecast track and the low probabilities of sustained tropical storm-force winds directly impacting the east coast port, a partial impact is the most reasonable assumption. This would likely lead to some vessels being diverted, delayed, or the port operating at reduced capacity for a short period. The ""1-10 vessels"" range captures this moderate impact.

The final answer is $\boxed{B}$.",D.

"* Vessels operating out of Port Everglades, FL should be prepared for potential tropical storm force winds, with probabilities increasing significantly by Monday evening.
* Given the forecast track and increasing wind probabilities, Port Everglades should implement preparations for the potential arrival of tropical storm conditions by early next week.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of the arrival of hazardous winds should seek an alternate port.
"* Vessel operations at Port Everglades, FL should proceed with caution as there is a 13% probability of tropical storm force winds by Wednesday morning.
* Mariners should monitor the storm's progress and be prepared for potential disruptions to operations.","Vessels wishing to remain must contact the Captain of the Port, obtain permission, and submit a written safe-mooring plan; drawbridges may not operate once sustained winds reach 25 mph or during an evacuation; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida that cannot offload and depart within 24 hours before threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"Port Everglades, FL has a 78% chance of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds by 06Z Tuesday, July 6th and a 23% chance of hurricane-force winds by 06Z Wednesday, July 7th.
