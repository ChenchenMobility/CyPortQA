"The cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days is not directly provided in the data. However, the data for Bradenton, FL (which is in Manatee County) shows the probabilities for each day. To find the cumulative probability, we sum the probabilities for each day:

Day 1: 2
Day 2: 2
Day 3: 1
Day 4: 1
Day 5: 1

Cumulative Probability = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7",19%
