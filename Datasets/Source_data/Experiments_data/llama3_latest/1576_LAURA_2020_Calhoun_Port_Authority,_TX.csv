Tornadoes are expected as an additional hazard.,Dangerous rip currents and large swells may affect vessel operations and channel pilotage even though the storm core remains well east
A few tornadoes are possible starting Wednesday evening over the area.,Dangerous surf and rip currents through Thursday; isolated tornado risk shifts inland well northeast of the port
Surf and rip current conditions.,"Rough seas, dangerous rip currents, and short-period halts to cargo operations likely Wednesday night through Thursday."
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Rough seas and dangerous rip currents in Matagorda Bay and near-shore Gulf waters may disrupt vessel movements.
Tornadoes may be possible.,High seas and dangerous rip currents in approaches; possible port access restrictions beginning late Wednesday
Tornadoes are a potential hazard.,High seas and dangerous surf beginning late Tuesday will likely shut down vessel movements; potential for minor coastal flooding during high tide.
"Swells generated by the storm could affect the area, impacting marine and port operations.",Very rough seas and higher-than-normal tides could halt vessel movements and cargo operations
Surf.,None anticipated beyond minor marine/sea-state deterioration along the middle Texas coast.
Surf.,Elevated seas and minor coastal flooding could disrupt vessel movements even if direct storm impacts remain east of the port
Surf.,None
