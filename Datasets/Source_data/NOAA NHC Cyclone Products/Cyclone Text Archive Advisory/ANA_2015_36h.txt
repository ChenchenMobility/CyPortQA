DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Subtropical Storm Ana was
located near latitude 31.7 North, longitude 77.4 West. The storm has
been meandering today, but is expected to begin a north-
northwestward motion overnight.  A turn toward the northwest with a
slight increase in forward speed is expected on Saturday.  On the
forecast track the center of Ana will be close to the coasts of
South and North Carolina on Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h), with higher
gusts.  Satellite images indicate that Ana continues its transition
to a tropical storm, which should be complete by early Saturday.
Little change in strength is expected while the storm approaches the
coastline over the next couple of days.

Winds of 40 mph extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from the
center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area, and possible within the watch areas, by Saturday evening.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters.
The water could reach 1 to 2 ft above ground at times of high tide
in coastal areas from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina southward
through South Carolina. For information specific to your area,
please see products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Ana is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 2 to
4 inches, with isolated amounts of 6 inches, over eastern portions
of North Carolina and South Carolina through the weekend.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ana are affecting portions of the
southeastern U.S. coast.  These swells will likely cause life-
threatening surf and rip currents.  Please see statements issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
