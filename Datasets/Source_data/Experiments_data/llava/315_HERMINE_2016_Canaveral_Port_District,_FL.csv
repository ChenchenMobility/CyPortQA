Explanation: The gale force probability (34kt) for a tropical storm is usually high at the center and diminishes rapidly with distance from the center. As the storm moves inland, the wind speeds decrease due to friction with land and loss of energy. Since the forecast suggests that the storm will make landfall soon, the gale force probability (34kt) would be expected to decrease rapidly after the 12-hour forecast.","{'in 12h': '6%', 'in 24h': 'additional 6% (cumulative 12%)', 'in 48h': 'additional 2% (cumulative 14%)', 'in 72h': '≈0%', 'in 96h': '≈0%'}"

"48-HOUR OUTLOOK:
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine
was located near latitude 23.6 North, longitude 84.3 West.  The
depression is moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn
toward the west-northwest is forecast today, followed by a slow
northwestward motion on Tuesday.  A turn toward the north is
expected Tuesday night.  On the forecast track, the center of the
depression will be passing north of the north coast of western Cuba
today, and moving farther into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico
tonight and Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and the
depression is likely to become a tropical storm later today or
tonight.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The depression is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches over Cuba, with isolated amounts of
12 inches possible through Wednesday.  These rains could cause
flash floods and mud slides.  Total rain accumulations of 3 to 5
inches are possible over the southern Florida peninsula and the
Florida Keys through Wednesday.  Isolated maximum amounts of 7
inches could occur over the Keys and coastal areas of southern
Florida.  This rainfall may cause localized flooding.
