"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at New Orleans, LA within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities listed for New Orleans, LA (which is not explicitly listed, so we'll use the closest relevant data points, such as New Iberia, LA, and Lake Charles, LA).

Since New Orleans is not listed, we'll use the data from New Iberia, LA, and Lake Charles, LA, as proxies. We'll take the highest probability from each time interval and sum them up.

For New Iberia, LA (34-kt winds):
- Day 1: 1
- Day 2: 11
- Day 3: 15
- Day 4: 14
- Day 5: 17

For Lake Charles, LA (34-kt winds):
- Day 1: 1
- Day 2: 11
- Day 3: 15
- Day 4: 14
- Day 5: 17

Summing the highest probabilities for each day:
1 + 11 + 15 + 14 + 17 = 58

However, since we are looking for the cumulative probability, we need to consider the probabilities at each time interval and sum them up. Given that the data points are not directly for New Orleans, we can estimate by averaging the probabilities from New Iberia and Lake Charles.

Average probabilities:
- Day 1: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
- Day 2: (11 + 11) / 2 = 11
- Day 3: (15 + 15) / 2 = 15
- Day 4: (14 + 14) / 2 = 14
- Day 5: (17 + 17) / 2 = 17

Summing these average probabilities:
1 + 11 + 15 + 14 + 17 = 58

Since we are looking for a single number representing the cumulative probability, we can use the highest cumulative probability from the available data points, which is 58. However, this is an overestimation because it sums the probabilities for each day separately rather than cumulatively.

To provide a more accurate estimate, we need to consider the cumulative nature of the probabilities. Since the data does not provide a direct cumulative probability for New Orleans, we can use the highest single-day probability as an upper bound estimate.

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at New Orleans, LA within the next 5 days is approximately:

17",16%
49,4%
7,7%
11,11%
0.19,0%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at New Orleans, LA within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities listed for the relevant locations and timeframes. However, the closest point to New Orleans in the data, which is New Orleans itself if available, or the nearest coastal points.

Given the city. However, New Orleans is not explicitly listed in the provided data. The closest relevant data points are likely New Orleans, LA (NOLA) or nearby coastal areas.

Since New Orleans is not listed, we need to consider the closest coastal points, which are likely to have similar weather patterns. The closest points in the data are:

- GFMX 280N 900W
- GFMX 280N 900W
- GFMX 280N 950W
- GFMX 270N 960W
- GFMX 250N 960W

However, these points are offshore and not directly comparable to New Orleans. Given the lack of direct data for New Orleans, we cannot provide an exact cumulative probability based on the provided information.

If we were to estimate based on nearby coastal points, we would need to average the probabilities from the closest points. However, since the question specifically asks for New Orleans and the data does not provide it, we cannot give a precise answer.

Therefore, based on the provided data, we cannot determine the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at New Orleans, LA within the next 5 days.",3%

"The table provided does not list New Orleans, LA directly. However, based on the locations provided, New Orleans would likely be represented by data from ""GFMX 270N 960W"" or another nearby Gulf of Mexico location. Since New Orleans is not listed explicitly, it's challenging to determine the exact probability interval for the 34-kt winds.

If we assume the closest relevant data is from ""GFMX 270N 960W,"" we can analyze the provided data:

- 0-12 hours: 5
- 12-24 hours: 94
- 24-48 hours: 1
- 48 hours or more: 0

The highest probability for 34-kt winds is in the 12-24 hours interval.

Tornadoes,Dangerous rip currents and elevated seas along the Gulf approaches; potential for isolated tornadoes in rainbands early next week.
Inland Flooding,Isolated tornadoes in outer rainbands; hazardous surf and rip currents
Freshwater Flooding,Brief tornadoes in outer rain bands; disruptive swells/rip currents on approaches to the Mississippi River delta
Rip currents,Prolonged heavy rain could lead to river rises along lower Mississippi and interfere with port logistics even without direct wind or surge effects
Tornadoes are possible as the storm approaches.,Long-period swells and dangerous rip currents on Gulf beaches; elevated seas in approaches to the Lower Mississippi River channel.
