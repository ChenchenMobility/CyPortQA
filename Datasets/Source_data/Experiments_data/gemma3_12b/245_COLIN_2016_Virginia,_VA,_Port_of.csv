"Based on the advisory, Tropical Storm Colin is expected to impact the southeastern coast of the United States, including areas near Virginia. The advisory mentions coastal flooding and dangerous surf. Given the average daily vessel count and the potential for disruption due to the storm, a reasonable estimate would be a significant impact.

Therefore, the answer is **D. 20 vessels or more**.",A.
"Based on the provided text, there's no mention of commercial vessel impacts or numbers specifically for the Port of Virginia. The advisory focuses on broader impacts like rainfall, storm surge, and wind hazards along the coasts of Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Virginia, VA, Port of.

However, given the nature of the advisory and the potential for disruption, the most reasonable assumption is that some level of impact is likely. Without specific data, I will select the middle of the choices.

**B. 1-10 vessels**",A.
"B. 1-10 vessels



**Reasoning:**

The advisory indicates that the depression will approach the Florida Big Bend area Monday afternoon. Virginia is significantly further north. The impact on Virginia is mentioned as ""interests along the coast of northeastern Florida through southern South Carolina should monitor the progress of this system."" The forecast suggests a monitoring situation, not a direct impact leading to significant vessel disruption. Given the daily average of 17.58 vessels and the relatively minor impact anticipated, it's reasonable to estimate a disruption of a few vessels.",A.
