DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sally was located
near latitude 29.1 North, longitude 88.0 West. Sally is moving 
toward the northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected to continue this morning. A northward turn is expected this 
afternoon, followed by a slow north-northeastward to northeastward 
motion tonight and continuing through Wednesday night. On the 
forecast track, the center of Sally will pass near the coast of 
southeastern Louisiana today, and make landfall in the hurricane 
warning area tonight or Wednesday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Although little change in strength is forecast until
landfall occurs, Sally is still expected to be a dangerous hurricane
when it moves onshore along the north-central Gulf coast.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the Air
Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Ocean Springs, MS to Dauphin Island, AL including Mobile Bay...6-9 
ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River to Ocean Springs, MS including Lake 
Borgne...4-7 ft
Dauphin Island, AL to AL/FL Border...4-7 ft
AL/FL Border to Okaloosa/Walton County Line, FL including Pensacola 
Bay and Choctawhatchee Bay...2-4 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...2-4 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River...1-3 ft
Okaloosa/Walton County Line to Chassahowitzka, FL including Saint 
Andrew Bay...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
damaging waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to begin within the
hurricane warning area this late afternoon or tonight. Tropical
storm conditions are occurring in portions of the warning area
across the western Florida Panhandle and Alabama, and  these
conditions will gradually spread westward this morning and continue
into Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Sally is expected to be a slow moving system as it
approaches land producing 10 to 20 inches of rainfall with isolated
amounts of 30 inches along and just inland of the central Gulf Coast
from the western Florida Panhandle to far southeastern Mississippi.
Historic flooding is possible with extreme life-threatening flash
flooding likely through Wednesday.  In addition, this rainfall will
lead to widespread moderate to major flooding on area rivers.
 
Sally is forecast to move inland early Wednesday and move 
across the Southeast producing rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with 
isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches, across portions of 
southeastern Mississippi, southern and central Alabama, northern 
Georgia, and the western Carolinas. Significant flash and urban 
flooding is likely, as well as widespread minor to moderate 
flooding on some rivers.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two will be possible this morning in
coastal areas of the Florida Panhandle and Alabama.  The tornado
threat should increase and slowly spread inland the rest of today
into Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells from Sally will continue to affect the coast from the
Florida Big Bend westward to southeastern Louisiana during the next
couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
