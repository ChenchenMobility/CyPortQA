"Based on the provided advisories and graphics, general vessel activity at Manatee County Port, FL, should cease immediately. Elsa is forecast to make landfall near the port by late Wednesday morning, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 20 miles from its center and tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 90 miles.",No vessels may enter or transit the ports without the Captain of the Port’s permission; all vessel movements are prohibited and mariners are advised that ports offer no safe havens.
"Given that Tropical Storm Elsa is forecast to make landfall along the west coast of Florida later today through tonight, with potential for hurricane strength conditions, it is strongly advised to cease all general vessel activity at Manatee County Port. Vessels should seek safe harbor or take necessary precautions to secure them against the expected high winds and storm surge.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens within these facilities; all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should make plans to depart the port and leave early to avoid bridge closures."
"Manatee County Port, FL is currently under a Hurricane Warning, with Elsa expected to make landfall nearby. Vessels should consider taking protective measures and adhering to port closure procedures due to the imminent threat of hurricane-force winds and storm surge.",No vessels may enter or transit the ports without the Captain of the Port’s permission; all vessel movements are prohibited and mariners are advised that ports offer no safe havens.
"Manatee County Port, FL is currently under a Storm Surge Warning and Tropical Storm Warning for Tropical Storm Elsa.

*   Vessel activity should be significantly curtailed, with preparations for tropical-storm-force winds and potential storm surge inundation.
*   All non-essential port operations should cease, and vessels should seek safe harbor or be secured in anticipation of hazardous conditions.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens within these facilities; all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should make plans to depart the port and leave early to avoid bridge closures."
"* Manatee County Port, FL, is under a Storm Surge Warning, indicating a danger of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the coastline.
* Given that Elsa is forecast to make landfall near the north Florida Gulf coast by late Wednesday morning and that Manatee County Port is located in an area with a 3 to 5 ft storm surge potential, port operations should prepare for significant disruption due to rising waters and potential hurricane-force winds.",All waterfront operations are suspended except final safety preparations approved by the Captain of the Port; facility storm preparations should already be complete.
"Port and facility operations at Manatee County Port, FL should prepare for potential tropical storm force winds, with the probability of sustained winds of 39 mph or greater exceeding 70% in the next 12 hours and 70% over the next 24 hours. Operations should also consider the risk of storm surge, as a Storm Surge Warning is in effect for the west coast of Florida, including Tampa Bay.","Ports and facilities should minimize the number of vessels in port, recognize that no safe havens are available, and continue to monitor Coast Guard Homeport for detailed guidance."
"Based on the provided information, Manatee County Port, FL (represented by Tampa FL in the probability table) has a 77% chance of experiencing tropical storm-force winds within the next 12 hours. Due to this high probability, port operations should expect significant disruptions and likely suspension of all non-essential vessel activity.",No vessels may enter or transit the ports without the Captain of the Port’s permission; all vessel movements are prohibited and mariners are advised that ports offer no safe havens.
"* Based on the track forecast cone and the wind speed probability table, Manatee County Port, FL has a low probability (less than 1%) of experiencing tropical storm-force winds (39+ mph) within the next 12 hours.
* Therefore, general vessel activity at Manatee County Port, FL is unlikely to be significantly impacted by Tropical Storm Elsa in the immediate 12-hour timeframe, though continued monitoring of the storm's progress is advised.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens within these facilities; all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should make plans to depart the port and leave early to avoid bridge closures."
"At 2 PM EDT on July 5th, Manatee County Port, FL is not under a tropical storm or hurricane warning. However, the probability of sustained tropical-storm-force winds reaching Manatee County Port within the next 24 hours is less than 5%, indicating a low risk of significant disruption to general vessel activity.",No vessels may enter or transit the ports without the Captain of the Port’s permission; all vessel movements are prohibited and mariners are advised that ports offer no safe havens.
"Vessel operations at Manatee County Port, FL should anticipate tropical storm-force winds, with a probability of sustained winds of 39 mph or greater reaching 15% to 35% between 2 AM EDT Monday and 2 AM EDT Tuesday. As Elsa is forecast to move near or over the west coast of Florida on Tuesday, port operations should prepare for potential disruptions.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens within these facilities; all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should make plans to depart the port and leave early to avoid bridge closures."
"* The forecast indicates that Manatee County Port, FL is likely to experience tropical storm-force winds (39+ mph) within the next 36 hours, with a cumulative probability of 51% by 6 AM EDT on Tuesday.
* Vessels should prepare for potential disruptions due to these expected wind conditions.",No vessels may enter or transit the ports without the Captain of the Port’s permission; all vessel movements are prohibited and mariners are advised that ports offer no safe havens.
"* Vessels at Manatee County Port, FL should expect tropical storm conditions within the next 36 hours, with a 14% chance of sustained winds of 39 mph or greater and a 1% chance of sustained winds reaching 58 mph.
* Port operations may need to begin preparations for potential disruptions due to these anticipated wind speeds.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens within these facilities; all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should make plans to depart the port and leave early to avoid bridge closures."
