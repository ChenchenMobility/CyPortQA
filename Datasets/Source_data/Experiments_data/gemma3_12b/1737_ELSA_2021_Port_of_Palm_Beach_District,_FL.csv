"Given that Hurricane Elsa is forecast to pass near Jamaica and eastern Cuba within 24 hours, and given Port Palm Beach's location within the potential influence zone of the storm, general vessel activity will likely be restricted or suspended. Expect a potential for delays, port closures, or adjusted schedules as the port prepares for potential impacts from wind and rain.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of the arrival of hazardous winds should seek an alternate port.
