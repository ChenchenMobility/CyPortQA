"The image does not provide sufficient information about the specific timing of when the port of Savannah, GA will experience tropical storm conditions. However, given that Eta is currently moving towards the west coast of Florida and has the potential to move inland over the northern portion of the Florida peninsula on Thursday, it is likely that the port of Savannah, GA may begin experiencing tropical storm conditions within 24 hours after the issuance of this advisory. Therefore, a reasonable estimate would be around 7:00 AM EST (12:00 UTC) on Wednesday, November 11th.

The JSON shows the probability of gale force winds (34kt) for each future 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96-hour period. The probabilities are represented as integers, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of gale force winds.

This suggests that the likelihood of gale force winds decreases over time.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '1%', 'in 72h': '2%', 'in 96h': '1%'}"
