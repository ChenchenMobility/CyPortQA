"The image you provided is a screenshot of a map and information about a cyclone, specifically Hurricane Matthew, from National Hurricane Center. It shows areas in the Atlantic Ocean where tropical cyclones form and affect coastal regions.

The map in question does not explicitly label the regions most likely to be affected by this particular storm, but it is clear that parts of Florida are at risk due to the proximity of the current track forecast. The image is not detailed enough to determine specific coastal regions or ports within those areas with a high degree of accuracy.

However, if you're referring to where ports might be most likely affected by tropical cyclones in general, coastal regions along the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the United States are frequently impacted by these types of storms. Some notable ports include:

- Port of Miami (Florida)
- Port of Fort Lauderdale (Florida)
- Port of Jacksonville (Florida)
- Port of Palm Beach (Florida)
- Port of Savannah (Georgia)
- Port of Charleston (South Carolina)
- Port of Wilmington (North Carolina)
- Port of Morehead City (North Carolina)
- Port of Virginia (Virginia)
- Port of Baltimore (Maryland)
- Port of Norfolk (Virginia)

Keep in mind that this list is not exhaustive and the specific ports that will be affected by Hurricane Matthew depend on its precise path and intensity.","Florida Keys, South Florida peninsula, and central U.S. Gulf Coast from AL to southeast LA"
