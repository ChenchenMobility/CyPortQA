Additionally, the timing of such events can be affected by a multitude of factors that are not within the scope of my capabilities.",None
"The image shows a forecast for a tropical storm or hurricane named ""Potential Tropical Cyclone Three."" It is expected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to the northern Gulf Coast starting later today. The current position of the system is near latitude 25.2 North, longitude 91.5 West. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

The image also includes a rainfall forecast, indicating that portions of the Central Gulf Coast may experience rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches. It suggests that flash, urban and small stream flooding impacts are likely across parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia.

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Intracoastal City, LA to the Okaloosa/Walton County line, FL, as well as Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and Metropolitan New Orleans. The warning area includes the Florida Panhandle, which has been added to the warning with this advisory.",None
"The image displays a tropical weather forecast from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for Potential Tropical Cyclone Three. This forecast includes a discussion on the storm's expected path and intensity, as well as specific details about the hazards affecting land areas, such as rainfall, storm surge, and wind conditions.

The storm is predicted to form over the west-central Gulf of Mexico tonight or early Friday, with formation chances through 48 hours and 5 days being high (90 percent). The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches). Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h), but strengthening is forecast tonight and Friday.

The storm is expected to produce total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches with isolated amounts of 8 inches across the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches are possible beginning Friday and continuing through the weekend from the Central Gulf coast northeastward into the Southern Appalachians, which will likely produce areas of flash, urban, and small stream flooding as well as minor to isolated moderate river flooding.

The storm surge is predicted to cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide:
- Intracoastal City, LA to MS/AL Border...2-3 ft
- Vermilion Bay and Lake Borgne...2-3 ft
- Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...1-2 ft
- MS/AL border to AL/FL border including Mobile Bay...1-3 ft
- Cameron, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...1-2 ft

The storm is also expected to bring wind conditions that could cause difficulties or dangers in outside preparations. Additionally, the threat for a couple of tornadoes should begin Friday afternoon across coastal Louisiana, with this threat expanding northward across southern portions of Louisiana and Mississippi, and southwest Alabama on Saturday.
