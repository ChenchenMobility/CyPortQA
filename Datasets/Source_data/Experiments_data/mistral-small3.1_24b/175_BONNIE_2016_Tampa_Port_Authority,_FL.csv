"The table does not include data for Tampa Port Authority, FL. Therefore, based on the provided information, the probability of 34-kt winds at Tampa Port Authority, FL does not rise above zero within the given time frames. However, since the question asks for the first time the probability rises above zero, and Tampa Port Authority is not listed, we cannot determine a specific time frame from the options provided.

Given the options:
A. 0 hours
B. 0-24 Hours
C. 24-48 hours
D. 48 hours or more

The correct answer is not determinable from the given data. If we were to infer based on the closest available data points (such as nearby locations), we might consider:

D. 48 hours or more

But this is an inference and not a direct answer from the provided table.",C.
