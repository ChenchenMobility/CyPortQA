,"Long-period swells may reach Southern California beaches this weekend, generating higher surf and rip-current risk but little operational impact inside the Port of Los Angeles"
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are possible.,"Long-period southerly swells generated by Lidia may reach Southern California beaches this weekend, increasing surf and rip-current risk and complicating small-craft operations."
Rip currents.,"Long-period swells may reach southern California beaches late this weekend, producing higher surf and rip-current risk, but port operations should not be significantly affected."
Rip currents.,"Long-period swells and enhanced rip currents may reach Southern California beaches toward the weekend, which could disrupt small-boat operations but should not significantly affect cargo handling within the port."

"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Reasoning:**

The advisory indicates potential tropical storm conditions and associated hazards (surf, rip currents) impacting Southern California. While not a direct hit, these conditions could cause delays, reroutings, and potentially impact the number of vessels calling at the Port of Los Angeles. A significant number of ships are impacted by disruptions.",A.

"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Reasoning:**

The advisory mentions potential hazards like high surf and rip currents impacting the Baja California Sur coastline. While the system's direct impact on the Port of Los Angeles is not explicitly stated, disruptions to shipping routes and potential delays due to weather conditions are likely. Given the potential for wider-ranging impacts and the average daily vessel count, a significant number of vessels could be affected.",A.
