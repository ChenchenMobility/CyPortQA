"The provided data does not include information for Boston, MA. Therefore, based on the given data, the answer is not determinable from the choices provided.

However, if we were to consider the closest relevant data point, which is ""GFMX 290N 850W,"" the first time the probability of 34-kt winds rises above zero is at 68 hours. Since none of the choices directly apply to Boston, MA, and the question specifies to answer with only a choice (A, B, C, or D), we cannot provide a precise answer based on the given data.
