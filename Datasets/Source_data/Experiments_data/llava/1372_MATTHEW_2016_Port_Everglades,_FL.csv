"The image you've shared appears to be a screenshot of a weather map or forecast from a reputable source. However, it doesn't show the current eye of a tropical cyclone in the format specified. To provide the coordinates of a cyclone's eye as requested, I would need more information and context such as the name of the storm, its tracking model, the time when it was last observed, and a way to pinpoint the exact location on the map provided.","31.2N, 80.5W"
"The image does not provide the exact coordinates for the current eye of the tropical cyclone. However, it does show a track forecast cone from National Hurricane Center and a map with current track, forecast path, and wind radii. It is essential to refer to updated information from official sources like NHC for accurate tracking and forecasting of storms.","29.4N, 80.5W"
"The image you've provided shows a map from the National Hurricane Center. Based on the available information in the image, it appears that there is no eye visible in the current forecast cone. This indicates that the cyclone's structure has not yet formed or that it may be dissipating.","27.1N, 79.2W"
"The image you provided shows a weather map with various weather information and forecasts. However, as an AI, I do not have access to real-time data or current meteorological conditions. Therefore, I am unable to provide you with the exact coordinates of the current eye of the tropical cyclone based on this single image.

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information about a tropical cyclone, it's best to refer to official sources such as the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in the United States or similar agencies worldwide. They provide detailed information about storm tracks, intensity, and other important details about tropical cyclones.","25.1N, 77.8W"
"The image provided does not display the exact coordinates for the current eye of the tropical cyclone.

"The image you've provided shows a weather map with various tropical cyclones. The map also includes a legend that lists storm names and their associated coordinates. There are two labeled storms in the image:

- Matthew: (53.0N, 82.1W)
- Irma: (32.4N, 77.6W)

The image does not provide information about where the current eye of a tropical cyclone is. However, according to the legend provided in the image, Matthew's current coordinates are (53.0N, 82.1W), and Irma's current coordinates are (32.4N, 77.6W).","21.8N, 75.2W"
"The image shows a weather map from the National Hurricane Center. However, without more context or specific details about the tropical cyclone's eye in this particular forecast cone, I'm unable to provide the coordinates of the current eye. The image displays an overview of the predicted track and intensity of the storm, but it does not show the exact location of the eye at that moment in time.","20.4N, 74.4W"
"The image you've provided shows a track forecast cone from the National Hurricane Center. However, it doesn't depict the current position of the eye of a tropical cyclone. To determine the location of the eye of a tropical cyclone, one would typically look for the center point where the pressure is the lowest in the storm.

In the image, there are two circular tracks labeled as ""Track Forecast Cone"" and ""Predicted Path of Hurricane Matthew."" The central path shows the expected trajectory of the hurricane based on meteorological models. However, without specific markers for the current eye or a legend that explains how to interpret the cone, I am unable to determine the coordinates where the eye is currently located.

To get this information, one would need to go to the National Hurricane Center website, which provides up-to-date information on the current position and forecast track of tropical cyclones.","18.9N, 74.3W"
"The image does not provide specific coordinates for the current eye of the tropical cyclone. It only shows a forecast track cone and a track map without displaying the current eye location.

"The question asks about the time when Port Everglades, FL will begin experiencing tropical storm conditions due to Hurricane Matthew. Based on the provided information, there is no specific time mentioned for when these conditions will begin at Port Everglades. However, considering that Matthew is moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h) and a turn toward toward the north-northeast and then to the northeast is expected on Saturday, we can assume that tropical storm conditions may start to affect Port Everglades sometime on Saturday or after. Therefore, the answer with ONLY a number would be 24 hours from the time the advisory was issued (which is 11:00 PM EDT).",12
