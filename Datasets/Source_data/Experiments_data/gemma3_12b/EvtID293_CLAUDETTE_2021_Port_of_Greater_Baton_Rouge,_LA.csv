"**C. 10-20 vessels**

Here's why:

*   **Event Duration:** The advisory indicates the system will impact the region ""later today, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous,"" and continue ""overnight into Saturday."" This suggests a roughly 24-36 hour period of significant impact.
*   **Impact Severity:** The advisory highlights potential for heavy rainfall, flooding, and storm surge. This would likely disrupt port operations and deter vessel arrivals/departures.
*   **Vessel Numbers:** Given the daily average of approximately 11 vessels, a disruption lasting a day and a half would reasonably lead to a reduction in the number of vessels present. The disruption and danger would deter most from coming or leaving.

Therefore, a reduction from the daily average of 10.76787344 would indicate a reduced count between 10 and 20.",A.
