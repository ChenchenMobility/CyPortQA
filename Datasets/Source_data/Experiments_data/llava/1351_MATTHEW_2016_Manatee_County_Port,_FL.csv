"There was no specific information provided about when the expected start of impact on freight at Manatee County Port, FL will occur. The advisory only mentions that ""Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the hurricane warning area in Florida during the next several hours and will spread northward within the warning area through Friday.""",10/5/2016 0:00
"The message does not provide specific information about when the impact on freight at Manatee County Port, FL will begin. However, it is noted that Hurricane Matthew is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to Florida within the next several hours and hurricane conditions are expected later today, which could affect operations at the port. For more detailed and updated information, one would need to monitor official advisories from local weather services or relevant authorities.",10/5/2016 0:00
"24-hour Outlook:
As of the 11 PM EDT advisory, the hurricane center is predicting that Matthew will pass near Andros Island and Nassau overnight, and very near the east coast of the Florida peninsula Thursday night through Friday night. The estimated minimum central pressure is 961 mb (28.38 inches). Wind speeds are expected to continue to be near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher gusts. It is forecast to be a category 4 hurricane as it approaches Florida. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km). The estimated minimum central pressure is 961 mb (28.38 inches). The next intermediate advisory will be issued at 2 AM EDT, and the next complete advisory will be issued at 5 AM EDT.

48-hour Outlook:
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and large waves could raise water levels by as much as the following amounts above normal tide levels...
Northern Coast of Cuba east of Camaguey...1 to 3 feet
The Bahamas...10 to 15 feet
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. Large waves generated by Matthew will cause water rises to occur well in advance of and well away from the track of the center. There is a danger of life-threatening inundation during the next 36 hours along the Florida east coast from Deerfield Beach to Fernandina Beach.

Please note that this information is based on the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center and may change as the storm progresses. It is important to stay informed about the latest developments by monitoring local news and weather updates, as well as following any evacuation orders or safety instructions provided by your local authorities.",10/5/2016 0:00
