At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Fourteen
was located near latitude 17.7 North, longitude 84.3 West.  The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A
slower northwestward motion is expected over the next couple of
days, followed by an increase in speed by Sunday and Monday.  On the
forecast track, the center of the system will approach the east
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico on Saturday.  The center
will then cross the northeastern part of the Yucatan Peninsula
Saturday night and move over the central Gulf of Mexico toward the
northwestern Gulf on Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and the 
depression is expected to become a tropical storm tonight.  The 
system could be near hurricane strength when it reaches the Yucatan 
Peninsula of Mexico late Saturday.  Additional strengthening is 
forecast Sunday and Monday as the system moves over the central Gulf 
of Mexico.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
