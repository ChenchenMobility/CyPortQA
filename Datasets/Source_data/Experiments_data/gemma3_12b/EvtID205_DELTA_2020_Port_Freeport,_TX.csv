**Explanation:**

The provided text does not give direct numbers of impacted vessels at Port Freeport. However, it mentions that Delta is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the central Gulf Coast, which includes the area around Port Freeport. Given the information and the average number of vessels daily, a reasonable estimate would be a disruption impacting a small number of vessels – likely between 1 and 3-5 disrupted, but unlikely to involve a large number.",A.
