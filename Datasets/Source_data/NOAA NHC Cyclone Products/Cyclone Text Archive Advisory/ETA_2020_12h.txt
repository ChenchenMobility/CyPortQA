DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM EST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eta was 
located by reconnaissance aircraft, Doppler radars, and satellites 
near latitude 27.3 North, longitude 83.6 West.  Eta is moving 
toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected to continue overnight, followed by a turn toward the 
north-northeast and northeast Thursday morning.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Eta will move closer to but just offshore of 
the west-central coast of Florida tonight, and move inland over the 
northern portion of the Florida peninsula on Thursday.  Eta is 
expected to move northeastward into the western Atlantic late 
Thursday and early Friday.
 
Data from the aircraft and NOAA Doppler weather radars indicate that 
maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Slow weakening is expected as Eta approaches the west coast 
of Florida tonight, followed by rapid weakening after landfall 
occurs on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center. A wind gust to 60 mph (96 km/h) was reported this 
afternoon at Punta Gorda, Florida, while a gust to 55 mph (89 km/h) 
was reported St. Petersburg.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Eta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC, and on the
web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anclote River to Boca Grande, FL including Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Boca Grande, FL to Bonita Beach, FL including Charlotte
Harbor...2-4 ft
Steinhatchee River to Anclote River...2-4 ft
Bonita Beach to Flamingo...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
RAINFALL:  Eta is expected to produce the following rainfall totals:
 
Western Cuba: an additional 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm) through
Wednesday, with isolated maximum storm total accumulations of 25
inches (765 mm).
 
West and central Florida, through Thursday: 2 to 4 inches, with
maximum storm total accumulations of 6 inches.
 
North and South Florida, through Thursday: An additional 1 to 2
inches, with isolated maximum storm total accumulations of 4 inches
in North Florida and 20 inches in South Florida.
 
Flash and river flooding will be possible in western Cuba through
Wednesday, along with landslides in areas of higher terrain.
Additional flash and urban flooding will be possible in South
Florida through Thursday, especially across previously inundated
areas. Flash,urban, and isolated minor river flooding is expected
across portions of West and North Florida through Thursday.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Tropical Storm 
Warning area along the Florida west coast by this afternoon and 
evening.  Tropical Storm conditions are possible in the watch area 
along the Florida Big Bend region by Thursday.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible through tonight over parts
of western and central Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Eta are expected to affect the north
coast of Cuba, southern and western Florida, and the Florida Keys
during the next day or so.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
