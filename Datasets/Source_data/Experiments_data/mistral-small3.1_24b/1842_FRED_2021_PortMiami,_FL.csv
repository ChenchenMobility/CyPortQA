"Based on the provided information, the storm is expected to impact the Florida Keys and south Florida starting on Saturday, August 14, 2021. Given that tropical-storm-force winds are possible and heavy rainfall is expected, which could lead to flooding and potential disruptions in port operations, we can estimate the recovery time.

Typically, ports may take a few days to recover from such conditions, depending on the extent of damage and necessary repairs. The Wind Probability Forecast Graphic and Future Wind Probability Table indicate that tropical-storm-force winds are likely to affect the Florida Keys and south Florida from Saturday, August 14, to Monday, August 16, 2021. Assuming that the port operations resume once the storm has passed and initial assessments and repairs are completed, we can estimate the recovery time.

Given the information, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations could recover within 3 days after the storm passes, accounting for assessments, repairs, and resumption of normal operations. Therefore, the answer is:
