"Tornadoes, rip currents",Long-period swells and dangerous rip currents for vessel approaches; isolated tornado risk in rainbands cannot be ruled out but is low this far west.
"Tornadoes, Rip Currents",Dangerous rip currents along Gulf beaches and possible brief coastal flooding at high tide
Rip current conditions.,Elevated seas and rip currents along the upper Texas coast could disrupt vessel movements and cargo operations.
Tornadoes may occur in association with the outer bands of the storm.,High surf and dangerous rip currents beginning late Monday; periodic squalls may temporarily reduce visibility for vessel movements.
Tornadoes are possible with this storm.,"Rough seas and elevated wave heights in the approaches to Houston Ship Channel beginning late Monday, posing restrictions for pilotage and cargo operations."
"Rip currents, isolated tornadoes.","Very rough seas (10–15 ft) in the approaches, possible brief tornadoes in outer rainbands; port operations may face berth closures and crane restrictions"
Rip currents.,Periods of lightning in outer convection bands; otherwise none significant
Tornadoes.,Increased seas and long-period swells Monday–Wednesday may require small-craft advisories and could disrupt pilot transfers and lightering operations.
Flooding and Tornadoes may occur,None significant identified at this lead time

"Based on the provided information, the port of interest is not specified. However, I will assume the port of interest is ""Galveston TX"" due to its high probability of being affected by tropical-storm-force winds. The wind probability table indicates that tropical-storm-force winds are likely to begin affecting Galveston TX around 48 hours (00Z TUE) and continue until 120 hours (00Z THU). The storm is expected to make landfall around 72-96 hours (Tue-Wed), with the most significant impacts likely occurring during this time. Assuming it takes one day for the storm to pass and initial assessments to be conducted, and considering the typical recovery time for ports after a tropical storm, I estimate that it would take 3 days for the port's freight to recover.",1.0
