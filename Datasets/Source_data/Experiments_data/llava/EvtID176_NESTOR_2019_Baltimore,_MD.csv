The potential for flooding due to rising waters from the storm surge.,Brief reduced visibility in heavy rain bands; elevated seas and short-period swell on approaches to Chesapeake Bay may affect pilot boarding operations
Nestor's presence could cause hazardous conditions for maritime activities along its track.,None
The cyclone's passage can lead to potential coastal flooding in Baltimore due to tidal surges.,Rough bay/near-shore seas and minor tidal flooding possible in the Chesapeake Bay
"The possible future storm could cause power outages due to strong winds in Baltimore, MD.",Elevated seas and minor coastal flooding/rip currents along Maryland beaches; brief marine squalls possible in outer rain bands.
