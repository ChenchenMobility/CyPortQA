"**B. 1-10 vessels**

Here's why:

*   **Ana's Track and Impact:** The advisory indicates Ana will be near the coasts of South and North Carolina by Sunday morning. Baltimore, MD, is considerably further north.
*   **Limited Direct Impact:** While there might be some indirect effects (e.g., altered routes due to weather), the advisory doesn's suggest a direct hit or severe disruption to Baltimore's port.
*   **Reasonable Disruption:** A small number of vessels could be delayed or rerouted due to the broader weather patterns, but a full-scale port closure isn't predicted.",C.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

Here's why:

*   **Location:** Baltimore is within the area under a Tropical Storm Warning.
*   **Impact:** The advisory mentions potential disruptions and hazards associated with the storm, which would likely impact vessel operations.
*   **Daily Average:** A daily average of over 14 vessels suggests a significant commercial traffic volume.
*   **Storm Severity:** The predicted rainfall and potential for disruption would likely lead to a significant reduction in commercial vessel traffic.



Therefore, the most logical answer is that the number of affected commercial vessels would exceed 20.",C.
"Based on the provided text, there's no mention of Baltimore, MD or any impact on commercial vessels specifically. The text focuses on the storm's path and potential impacts on coastal areas of North and South Carolina. Therefore, we can't determine the number of impacted vessels at Baltimore.

Given the lack of information, the most appropriate answer is **A. None** because there's no indication of any impact.",C.
C. 10-20 vessels,C.
D. 20 vessels or more,C.
