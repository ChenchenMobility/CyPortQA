"The cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Port of Brunswick, GA within the next 5 days is not directly provided in the data. However, based on the data for nearby locations, we can infer that the probability is very high.

For Brunswick, GA (Port of Brunswick, GA), we can look at similar nearby locations such as Kings Bay, GA, and Savannah, GA. Both locations show a 34-kt wind probability of 3 within the next 5 days.

Given the proximity and similar weather patterns, it is reasonable to infer that the cumulative probability for Brunswick, GA, is also very high. However, since the specific data for Brunswick, GA, is not provided, we cannot give an exact number.

If we were to estimate based on the nearby locations, it would be:
