"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The forecast advisory indicates that ""portions of southern Florida"" will experience hurricane conditions, and Tampa is within that region. Given the potential for severe conditions and the need to avoid risk, it's highly probable that the port authority would order a complete cessation of vessel traffic. While the exact number is impossible to determine without specific port authority plans, a complete shutdown would mean a significant number of vessels would be impacted, well beyond the daily average.",A.
"B. 1-10 vessels



**Explanation:**

The provided text focuses on Irma's path and potential impacts across the Caribbean and Bahamas, eventually reaching Florida. It doesn’t provide a specific forecast for Tampa Port Authority, nor does it mention a number of vessels expected to be impacted. Given the nature of the advisory and the general guidance, a small number of vessels (1-10) might be affected, primarily due to port closures or rerouting to avoid the storm.",A.
