"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The provided text doesn's contain a number of commercial vessels that would be impacted. Therefore, answering this question requires an understanding of the potential impact of a hurricane of Delta's strength on a major port like Lake Charles. Given the predicted rainfall amounts and potential for flooding, a port like Lake Charles would likely see significant disruption. It is likely that many vessels would be delayed in arriving or leaving the port.",C.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

*   **Delta's Projected Path:** Hurricane Delta is forecast to move over the northeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula and then over the southern Gulf of Mexico. This path puts Lake Charles, LA, directly in the path of the storm's effects.
*   **Storm Surge and Wind Hazards:** The projected storm surge (6-9 feet) and hurricane-force winds in Lake Charles pose significant hazards to commercial vessels. Vessels would likely be evacuated or seek shelter well in advance of the storm's arrival.
*   **Disruption to Operations:** Ports typically shut down operations during hurricanes, leading to a significant decrease in the number of vessels present. It's reasonable to expect a major disruption, with many vessels evacuating the area to avoid the storm.
*   **Given the scale of the predicted hazards**, it is more likely than not that 20 or more vessels will be directly impacted, even if only by being present in the district during some portion of the storm’s effects.",C.
D. 20 vessels or more,C.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The provided text indicates that Lake Charles Harbor District, LA, is predicted to experience impacts from Tropical Storm Delta, with hurricane conditions possible. Given the potential for severe weather, it's reasonable to expect a significant disruption to commercial vessel traffic. Considering the average daily vessel count of 8.42 and the potential for disruption, a higher impact number (20 or more) is the most logical choice.",C.
