DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 10.6 North, longitude 48.3 West.  Beryl is moving
toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A faster westward to
west-northwestward motion is expected to begin over the weekend and
continue through early next week.  On the forecast track, the center
of Beryl will approach the Lesser Antilles over the weekend and
cross the island chain late Sunday or Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next couple of
days, and Beryl could still be a hurricane when it reaches the
Lesser Antilles late Sunday or Monday.  Weakening is expected once
Beryl reaches the eastern Caribbean Sea on Monday, but the system
may not degenerate into an open trough until it reaches the vicinity
of Hispaniola and the central Caribbean Sea.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from
the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to
35 miles (55 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm or hurricane conditions are possible within
the watch areas by late Sunday or Monday.
