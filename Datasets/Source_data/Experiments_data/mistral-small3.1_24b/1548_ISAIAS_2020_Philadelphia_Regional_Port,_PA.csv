Rip Current,"Brief reduced visibility in squalls, elevated river levels, and possible logistical delays due to regional roadway flooding"
Tornadoes,Potential river rise and debris flow affecting terminal operations due to upstream rainfall
Flooding and rough seas.,"Very rough Delaware River conditions, strong currents, and elevated river stages could interrupt cargo handling and vessel movements"
There is no additional hazards.,Indirect impacts such as upstream cargo delays from Caribbean/Florida ports may occur before any direct weather reaches Philadelphia
