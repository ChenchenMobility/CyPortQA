"Based on the information provided and assuming that there is a linear relationship between the number of commercial vessels daily at Wilmington, NC and the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels over the entire event, we can estimate the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Wilmington, NC over the entire event using the following formula:

Total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels = (Average number of vessels daily) x (Duration of the storm event)

where the average number of vessels daily at Wilmington, NC is 3.211439002 and the duration of the storm event is not provided in the image. However, we can assume that it will last for 1 to 2 days based on the forecast track of the storm, which is expected to approach the coast Thursday afternoon and make landfall later that day or early Friday.

Using this information, we can estimate that the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Wilmington, NC over the entire event will be between:

1 x 3.211439002 x (1-2 days) = 6.423778 to 12.823558 total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels

Based on this estimate, the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Wilmington, NC over the entire event will be in the range of A or B, which would fall under none or 1-10 vessels respectively.
