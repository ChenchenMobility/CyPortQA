"There are no additional hazards visible in the image or provided for the Tampa Port Authority, FL.",Increased rip-current risk in the Gulf may occur but no major operational hazards expected
Additional hazards could include potential for power outages or disruptions to port operations due to high winds or flooding in the area.,Occasional lightning in squalls; choppy bay/near-shore seas could hamper small-craft movements
High tides or flooding from nearby bodies of water.,Brief reductions in visibility and increased lightning risk in squalls; potential vessel schedule disruptions due to precautionary routing around the peninsula.
None,Rough bay/near-shore seas and higher than normal tides could briefly affect small-craft operations
Additional hazards include potential flooding from heavy rain and strong currents due to increased winds and waves.,"Minimal – routine marine operations may see higher Atlantic swells, but Gulf waters near the port remain largely undisturbed."
Flooding from heavy rainfall,Choppy bays/seas and dangerous rip currents in the eastern Gulf could briefly disrupt vessel movements.
The storm may cause disruptions to port operations and increased safety concerns for vessels in the vicinity.,Choppy seas in the approaches to Tampa Bay and occasional squalls could disrupt vessel scheduling even without a direct strike.
"There are no other hazards displayed in the image, as it focuses on tropical cyclones and their potential impacts.",Dangerous rip currents and rough seas in approaches; intermittent squalls reducing visibility and hampering cargo handling
