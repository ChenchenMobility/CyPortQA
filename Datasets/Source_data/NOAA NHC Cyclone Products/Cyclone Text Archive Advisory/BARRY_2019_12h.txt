DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barry was
located near latitude 28.6 North, longitude 91.0 West. Barry is
moving toward the west-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A motion
toward the northwest should begin overnight, followed by a turn
toward the north Saturday night or Sunday.  On the forecast track,
the center of Barry will approach the south-central coast of
Louisiana tonight and then make landfall along the south-central
Louisiana coast on Saturday.  After landfall, Barry is expected to
move generally northward through the Mississippi Valley through
Sunday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast before landfall, and Barry is
expected to be a hurricane when the center reaches the Louisiana
coast on Saturday.  Weakening is expected after Barry moves inland.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.  An observation platform at South Timbalier Block
off the coast of Louisiana has recently reported a sustained wind
of 47 mph (76 km/h) with a gust to 59 mph (94 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Barry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Intracoastal City to Shell Beach...3 to 6 ft
Shell Beach to Biloxi MS...3 to 5 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...3 to 5 ft
Biloxi MS to the Mississippi/Alabama border...2 to 4 ft
Lake Maurepas...1 to 3 ft

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Barry is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
10 to 20 inches over south-central and southeast Louisiana and
southwest Mississippi, with isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches.
These rains are expected to lead to dangerous, life threatening
flooding over portions of the central Gulf Coast into the Lower
Mississippi Valley beginning as early as Saturday morning.  Across
the remainder of the Lower Mississippi Valley, total rain
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches are expected, with isolated maximum
amounts of 12 inches. By early next week, Barry is expected to
produce rainfall accumulations of 4 to 8 inches across western
portions of the Tennessee Valley.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the Hurricane Warning
area later tonight or Saturday, with tropical storm conditions
currently spreading across the area.  Hurricane conditions are
possible within the Hurricane Watch area tonight or Saturday
morning.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring across the
Tropical Storm Warning area in southeastern Louisiana at this time.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch
area by tonight or Saturday.  Wind gusts to tropical-storm force in
squalls are possible along portions of the coasts of Alabama and the
western Florida Panhandle through Saturday night.

TORNADOES:  A couple tornadoes are possible late tonight through
Saturday across southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi.
