"It is not possible to predict the exact number of days it will take for the port's freight to recover after a hurricane. The impact of a hurricane on a port's operations can be significant and may vary depending on the severity of the storm, the extent of damage to infrastructure, and the response efforts of the port authority. It is important for the port to conduct thorough assessments of any damages sustained during the storm and to develop a comprehensive recovery plan in order to restore operations as quickly and safely as possible.",1.0
"Based on the latest forecast and advisories from the National Hurricane Center, it is difficult to predict the exact number of days it will take for the port's freight to fully recover after Hurricane Florence. Factors such as the extent of damage, the severity of the storm, and the efficiency of recovery efforts can all impact the length of time required for recovery. It would be best for any inquiries regarding the impact of Hurricane Florence on the port's freight to monitor updates from the National Hurricane Center and local authorities as they become available.",1.0

"It is impossible to determine the exact number of days it will take for a port to recover without knowing the specific conditions and impacts of the storm, as well as any potential post-storm issues that may arise. However, in general, ports can experience significant disruptions following major storms, which could range from several days to weeks or even months.",1.0
"The image shows a tropical storm warning with information about the storm, including its location, size, wind speed, and direction of movement. It also lists areas under watch or warning, such as storm surge warnings for certain parts of North Carolina and South Carolina, hurricane warnings for those areas plus parts of Virginia, and a tropical storm watch for some regions to the north. The text discusses the potential impacts of the storm, including heavy rainfall, wind, and storm surge. It provides information on what to expect in terms of flooding, as well as recommendations for individuals in affected areas.",1.0
