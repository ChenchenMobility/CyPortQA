"A nice weather forecast!

According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) report, there is no cumulative probability mentioned for Boston, MA.

However, if you're asking about the probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Boston, MA within the next 5 days, I can tell you that it's not a straightforward calculation.

D. 20 vessels or more,A.
"Based on the provided information, it seems that there is no specific data on the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Boston, MA over the entire event. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the average number of vessels daily.

Since the event is expected to affect Boston, MA, let's assume that a significant portion of these vessels will be affected. Let's use the average daily vessel count as a baseline and scale it up according to the duration of the event.

Assuming the event lasts for 3 days (based on the advisory timeline), we can multiply the average daily vessel count by the number of days:

3.939762702 vessels/day * 3 days = 11.819287206 vessels

Given that this estimate is rough and doesn't take into account specific details about the event, let's round up to the nearest tens digit:

11-20 vessels

This corresponds to option C in the provided choices.",A.
