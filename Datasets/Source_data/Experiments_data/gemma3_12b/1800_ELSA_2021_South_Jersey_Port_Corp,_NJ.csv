Rip currents and coastal erosion are potential hazards.,"Isolated brief tornadoes cannot be ruled out Friday, and thunderstorm-related lightning may cause short cargo-handling stoppages"
,"Brief, isolated tornadoes are possible as Elsa’s remnants pass; rough seas and dangerous rip currents likely Thursday-Friday"
,Brief tornado threat and short-fuse marine squalls possible as the storm’s remnant center crosses nearby
,"Brief, isolated tornado threat cannot be ruled out as outer rain-bands sweep across New Jersey late Friday"
,High surf and dangerous rip currents; brief spin-up tornadoes can’t be ruled out as the storm exits
"Potential hazards include coastal erosion, navigational hazards from displaced debris, and disruptions to port operations due to potential supply chain issues.",Elevated seas and swells may disrupt river/ocean pilotage; brief visibility reductions in heavy downpours; possible debris flow from upstream watershed raising Delaware River levels
,Enhanced rip currents and rough surf along the New Jersey beaches.
Rip currents are a potential hazard.,"Rough seas and high surf could impact Delaware Bay approaches, leading to navigation restrictions or pilotage delays."

**Reasoning:**

The provided text focuses on Tropical Storm Elsa's impact on Cuba and Florida. It does not mention any specific impact or disruption to the South Jersey Port Corporation or commercial vessel traffic in New Jersey. While the storm *could* indirectly affect vessel schedules, there's no information to suggest a significant impact. Therefore, the most logical answer is that there would be no direct impact on the number of commercial vessels at the port.",A.
A. None,A.
A. None,A.
,A.
"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Elsa's Impact:** The provided text indicates Elsa will impact areas including the Florida Keys and Florida Peninsula early next week. While South Jersey Port Corp is not directly mentioned, the overall event will impact nearby regions in the Atlantic.
*   **Disruptions:** Tropical storms can cause disruptions to shipping routes, delays, and potential rerouting of vessels to avoid hazardous conditions.
*   **Port Activity:** While the average daily activity is 12.28080316 vessels, a significant storm in the vicinity will likely cause disruptions and reduce this number.
*   **Consideration:** Given the potential for rerouting and delays, a noticeable reduction in vessel traffic is probable. The duration of the impact would also be a factor.

Given these considerations, the most likely answer is **A. None**.",A.
