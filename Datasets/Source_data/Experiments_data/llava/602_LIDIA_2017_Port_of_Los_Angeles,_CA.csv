The advisory notes that a dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds on the southern portion of Baja California Sur. It also advises that swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast of southwestern and western Mexico, and southern portions of Baja California Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
