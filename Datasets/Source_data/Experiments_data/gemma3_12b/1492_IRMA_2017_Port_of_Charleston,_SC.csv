"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Charleston's Average:** 11.00365075 vessels daily.
*   **Event Duration:** The advisory mentions impacts ""tonight and Sunday"", which equates to approximately 36 hours.
*   **Total Estimate:** 36 hours / 24 hours/day * 11.00365075 vessels/day = ~ 16.505 vessels.
*   **Rounding:** Given the context, it's likely to round to 17 vessels (as the closest selection).

Therefore, the correct answer is **C. 10-20 vessels**.",D.
"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Charleston's Daily Average:** 11.00365075 vessels.
*   **Event Duration:** The advisory mentions impacts across several days - a period of several days (at least 2-3 days, based on the forecast for Georgia, South Carolina, and Western North Carolina across days).
*   **Severity of Impact:** The advisory describes ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,"" suggesting a significant disruption. Given these impacts, a likely scenario involves a full or near-full port closure, with a number of vessels potentially impacted.

Based on this, the most reasonable answer is **D. 20 vessels or more.**",D.
A. None,D.
"Based on the provided text, there is **no information** about the number of commercial vessels expected to be impacted at the Port of Charleston, SC. The advisory focuses on wind, rain, and surge impacts, not vessel traffic.

Therefore, I cannot answer the question. However, if I had to choose a *guess*, given the uncertainty, it would be:

**A. None**",D.
"**Understanding the Context**

The provided text focuses on Hurricane Irma's path and potential impacts across the Caribbean and Bahamas. It *doesn't* directly mention the Port of Charleston, South Carolina, or any specific number of vessels expected to be affected.

**The Problem:**

The question asks for an estimate of the number of commercial vessels affected at the Port of Charleston, based *solely* on the provided text. Since the text doesn't mention Charleston, any answer would be pure speculation. However, it does provide the average number of vessels daily (11.00365075). Therefore, the closest, most logical assumption is that at least a small number of vessels would be impacted.

**Therefore, the best answer is:**

**B. 1-10 vessels**",D.
