"Based on the provided information, the port of Miami is expected to experience tropical-storm-force winds starting from day 3 (Friday) with a cumulative probability of 9% and peaking at day 4 (Saturday) with a cumulative probability of 11%. The storm is expected to move away from the port afterwards. Given that tropical-storm-force winds can cause disruptions to port operations, and considering the typical time it takes for ports to recover from such events, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations may take approximately 3 days to recover. This estimation includes the time for the storm to pass and for the port to resume normal operations.
