"The image shows an advisory for potential Tropical Cyclone Three, which indicates that impacts from heavy rainfall and tropical-storm-force winds are expected to spread across portions of the northern Gulf Coast tonight or early Saturday. The advisory states that a northeastward or east-northeastward motion across the southeastern United States is forecast after landfall through the weekend. It also mentions that the system will make landfall along the north-central Gulf Coast tonight or early Saturday, with tropical storm conditions beginning to reach the coast within the warning area and continuing into Saturday. The advisory does not provide a specific date for the expected start of impact on freight at Texas City, TX.",None
"The image shows an advisory from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) about Potential Tropical Cyclone Three.

"The image you've shared contains a weather bulletin from the National Weather Service regarding a potential tropical cyclone over the Gulf of Mexico. It is not possible to determine specific details about freight operations at Texas City, TX just by looking at this bulletin. To answer your question about when the predicted peak impact on freight at Texas City might occur, I would need additional information such as the exact forecast track and intensity of the storm, and the specific operational schedule of the freight at the location you are inquiring about.",None
"The image does not provide information about the expected end of impact on freight at Texas City, TX. However, I can give you an idea about the possible duration based on typical tropical storms. Generally, a tropical storm system moves at a pace of 5 to 20 mph. Assuming the storm moves at an average speed of 10 mph (a common speed for tropical storms), it would take approximately 3-4 hours to travel from Texas City, TX (located on the upper right coast of Texas) to Morgan City, LA, which is the next coastal city along the Gulf Coast. If the storm system maintains its intensity and doesn't undergo a significant decay or dissipation, it could take an additional 3-4 hours to reach Mobile Bay, AL (located near the Alabama-Mississippi border). This would mean that the impact on freight at Texas City, TX might last around 6-8 hours. Please note that this is an estimation based on average storm speeds and may not reflect the actual duration of impact for a particular system.",None
