DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Zeta was
located a NOAA reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 17.7 North,
longitude 83.6 West. Zeta is currently stationary and is continuing
to re-organize. However, a slow north-northwestward to northwestward
motion is expected to resume later today. A turn toward the
west-northwest and an increase in forward speed are forecast by
Monday, followed by a faster northwestward motion on Tuesday. On the
forecast track, the center of Zeta will pass south of western Cuba
early Monday and move near or over the northern Yucatan Peninsula or
Yucatan Channel late Monday, move into the southern Gulf of Mexico
on Tuesday, and reach the central Gulf of Mexico by late Tuesday.
 
Data from the aircraft indicate that maximum sustained winds are
near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Gradual strengthening is
expected during the next 48 to 72 hours, and Zeta is forecast to
become a hurricane by early Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km),
mainly southeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on reports from the
NOAA aircraft is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
