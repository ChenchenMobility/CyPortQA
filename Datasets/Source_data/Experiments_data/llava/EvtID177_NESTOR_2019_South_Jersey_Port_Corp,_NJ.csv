"The image depicts a map showing the track of a tropical cyclone (Hurricane) with a forecast cone. It shows a wide range of possible paths for the cyclone, indicating uncertainty in its future movement. The affected coastal area, as indicated by the National Hurricane Center, is 'Florida'.",Tropical-storm watches posted only along parts of the southeast Atlantic coast – none north of Cape Hatteras

"The image you provided shows a map from the National Hurricane Center, which includes a track forecast cone for an active tropical cyclone. However, it does not provide the current position of the eye in terms of coordinates (e.g., 32.4N, 77.6W). To obtain that information, you would typically look at the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center or other trusted weather forecasting agencies. I recommend checking their website for updates on the storm's position.","24.1N, 93.2W"
"The image you provided does not show the current position of a tropical cyclone, but rather a storm forecast cone from the National Hurricane Center. This type of graphic is used to predict the potential track and intensity of a storm system based on current weather data and models. It shows the most likely path that a storm could take as it moves across the ocean or through a region. The forecast cone typically includes several possible paths, with each point representing a different scenario for how the storm might evolve over time.","22.6N, 95.5W"
