"The question is asking for the probability of sustained winds of at least 34 kt (39 mph or 63 km/h) at specific locations in Texas and Louisiana over the next 5 days, based on the Future Wind Probability Table from National Hurricane Center. The table shows the cumulative probability of reaching certain wind speed thresholds, including 34 kt, 50 kt, and 64 kt, for each location and time period. To find out how many hours remain until the 34-kt wind probability peaks at Port Arthur, TX within the next 5 days, we need to look at the table and determine when the cumulative probability reaches its peak for that location and time period.
