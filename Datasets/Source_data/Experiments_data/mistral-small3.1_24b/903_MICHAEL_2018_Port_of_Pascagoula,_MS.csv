"The provided data does not include specific information for the Port of Pascagoula, MS. However, we can use the nearest available data points to estimate the cumulative probability. The nearest points are GFMX 280N 890W and Buras LA.

For GFMX 28890W at 34 kt:
- Day 1: 3
- Day 2: 2 (cumulative: 5)
- Day 3: X (cumulative remains 5)
- Day 4: X (cumulative remains 5)
- Day 5: X (cumulative remains 5)

For Buras LA at 34 kt:
- Day 1: 2
- Day 2: 2 (cumulative: 4)
- Day 3: X (cumulative remains 4)
- Day 4: X (cumulative remains 4)
- Day 5: X (cumulative remains 4)

Given that Buras LA is closer to Pascagoula, we can use its data as a more reliable estimate. Therefore, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at the Port of Pascagoula, MS within the next 5 days is approximately 4.",5%

"The data provided does not include information for the Port of Pascagoula, MS. Therefore, I cannot calculate the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at that location.",10%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Port of Pascagoula, MS within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities provided for each day and sum them up.

However, the provided data does not include specific probabilities for Port of Pascagoula, MS. Instead, it includes probabilities for nearby locations such as Gulfport, MS, and Stennis, MS. We can use the probabilities for these nearby locations as a proxy for Port of Pascagoula, MS.

For Gulfport, MS:
- Day 1: 0%
- Day 2: 3%
- Day 3: 6%
- Day 4: 9%
- Day 5: 18%

Summing these probabilities:
0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 36

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Port of Pascagoula, MS within the next 5 days is approximately 36%. However, since the question asks for a number without any units or context, the answer is:

The cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Stennis MS within the next 5 days is:

10 (day 1) + 7 (day 2) = 17

So, the answer is 17.",21%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at the Port of Pascagoula, MS within the next 5 days, we need to identify the relevant data from the provided table. The Port of Pascagoula, MS is not explicitly listed, but we can use the data for nearby locations such as Gulfport, MS, and Pascagoula, MS (if available).

Since Pascagoula, MS is not listed, we will use the data for Gulfport, MS as a proxy, assuming similar wind conditions.

For Gulfport, MS:
- Day 1: 4
- Day 2: 12
- Day 3: 2
- Day 4: 3
- Day 5: X (assumed to be 0)

The cumulative probability is the sum of these probabilities:

Given that the data for Gulfport MS and Stennis MS are:
- Gulfport MS: 0 (0, 0, 6, 9, 18)
- Stennis MS: (0, 0, 2, 4, 7)

We can estimate the cumulative probability for Port of Pascagoula, MS by averaging the probabilities for Gulfport MS and Stennis MS.

For Gulfport MS:
- Day 1: 0

For Stennis MS:
- Day 1: 0

- Day 3: (6 + 2) / 2 = 4
- Day 4: (9 + 4) / 2 = 6.5
