"The image you've provided contains a bulletin from the National Weather Service (NWS) about Tropical Storm Arthur and its potential impacts. While the bulletin does not explicitly mention freight at the Philadelphia Regional Port, it does provide a forecast track for the storm, which includes the Mid-Atlantic region where the port is located.

The expected peak impact on freight could be during the time when the storm is closest to the coast of North Carolina and moving toward the northeast. This would likely be around Monday or Tuesday, as suggested in the bulletin's timeline. The specific date for the peak impact would depend on the exact track and timing of the storm, which could vary based on future forecasts from the NWS.

Please note that freight operations can be affected by a variety of factors beyond just the storm, including logistics, scheduling, and weather conditions at the port itself. Therefore, the actual peak impact may not exactly correspond to the storm's peak intensity or landfall.",None

"The image shows a storm track for Tropical Storm Arthur, which has the potential to bring significant winds and flooding to certain coastal areas. The forecast indicates that the storm is expected to maintain its current trajectory, moving north-northeastward over the next few days.

The map provided with the forecast shows the probability of sustained wind speeds of at least 34 knots (39 mph) for specific locations across a region including Virginia, North Carolina, and parts of the adjacent states. The color coding in the image helps to quickly identify which areas are most likely to experience these stronger winds.

The forecast also includes information on the predicted storm path, the location where the storm is expected to make landfall or come closest to land, and an estimate of the maximum sustained wind speeds within the storm's center. The warning is in effect for coastal North Carolina and parts of adjacent states, indicating that people in these areas should be prepared for potential impacts such as power outages, property damage, and transportation disruptions.
