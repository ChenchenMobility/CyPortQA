"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory indicates ""Tropical storm conditions should spread westward and northward through the Tropical Storm Warning area"". Beaumont, TX falls within the area that will experience these conditions. Given the predicted heavy rainfall and potential for strong winds, commercial vessel operations would likely be significantly disrupted. It is reasonable to assume that the number of vessels at Beaumont would be greatly reduced during the event. The ""20 or more"" option best reflects the significant disruption expected.",D.
