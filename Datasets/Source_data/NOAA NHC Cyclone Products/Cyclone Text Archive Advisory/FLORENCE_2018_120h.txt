DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Florence was
located near latitude 24.4 North, longitude 57.0 West. Florence is
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue today.  A west-northwestward motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected by Monday, and that motion is
forecast to continue through mid-week.  On the forecast track, the
center of Florence will move over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean
between Bermuda and the Bahamas Tuesday and Wednesday, and approach
the southeastern coast of the United States on Thursday.

Aircraft and satellite data indicate that maximum sustained winds
have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher gusts. Florence
is forecast to rapidly strengthen to a major hurricane by Monday,
and is expected to remain an extremely dangerous major hurricane
through Thursday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).  Florence is forecast to become larger over the next few
days.

The estimated minimum central pressure from NOAA Hurricane Hunter
and satellite data is 975 mb (28.80 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Florence are affecting Bermuda and
portions of the U.S. East Coast.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
