A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northeastern U.S. and Atlantic Canada
should monitor the progress of Henri.  Additional watches or
warnings will likely be required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Henri was 
located near latitude 30.8 North, longitude 73.8 West. Henri is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h). A turn 
toward the north is expected by tonight, and Henri is forecast to 
accelerate in that direction through early Sunday.  On the forecast 
track, Henri is expected to make landfall in southern New England by 
late Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during the 
next couple of days, and Henri is expected to become a hurricane 
by Saturday and be at or near hurricane strength when it makes 
landfall in southern New England.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key messages for Henri can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Watch Hill, RI to Sagamore Beach, MA including Narragansett Bay,
Buzzards Bay, Vineyard Sound, Nantucket Sound, and Cape Cod
Bay...3-5 ft
East Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...2-4 ft
North shore of Long Island...2-4 ft
Flushing, NY to Watch Hill, RI...2-4 ft
Cape May, NJ to East Rockaway Inlet, NY...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch
area on Sunday, with tropical storm conditions possible by early
Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical
storm watch area on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Henri may produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches over
eastern Long Island and southern New England Sunday into Monday,
with isolated maximum totals near 8 inches. Heavy rainfall from
Henri will result in flash, urban, and small stream flooding, along
with the potential for widespread minor and isolated moderate river
flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Henri should continue to affect Bermuda
during the next day or so.  Swells are expected to increase across
much of the east coast of the U.S. and Atlantic Canada today and
into the weekend.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
