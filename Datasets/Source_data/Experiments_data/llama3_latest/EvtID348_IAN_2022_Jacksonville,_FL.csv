"Based on the information provided, it is suggested that general vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL should exercise caution due to the expected strong winds, heavy rainfall, and potential storm surge from Hurricane Ian, with an emphasis on monitoring local weather reports and following any evacuation orders or guidance from local authorities.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"Based on the advisory, no specific guidance is provided for Jacksonville, FL, but vessels in the area are advised to monitor products issued by your national meteorological service and be aware of Ian's potential impact on Florida's weather conditions. It is recommended that general vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL, take cautionary measures such as monitoring weather forecasts and warnings, and preparing for potential tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall.","Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida that cannot offload and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"As Hurricane Ian approaches western Cuba and is expected to affect Florida's west coast, it is suggested that all ocean-going and commercial vessels in the area take immediate action to prepare for possible weather-related disruptions, including halting operations, securing cargo, and positioning vessels away from potential storm surge zones. Additionally, vessels should closely monitor official updates and follow guidance from local authorities regarding safe harbor operations and potential evacuation orders.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"Based on Tropical Storm Ian's advisory, no specific guidance is provided for ocean-going and commercial vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL, as the storm is not expected to affect the city directly. However, mariners are advised to monitor updates from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and local authorities for potential changes in weather conditions and any subsequent guidance on vessel movement or anchoring.","Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida that cannot offload and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"Based on the forecasted storm surge and flooding risks, it is suggested that port and facility operations in Jacksonville, FL take necessary precautions to prepare for potential flooding and strong winds, including securing any loose equipment or debris, shutting down non-essential operations, and monitoring weather updates closely.","Ports and waterfront facilities should continue storm preparations, ensure the inventory of vessels is minimized, and remind users that the facilities do not provide safe haven during the storm."
"Given Tropical Storm Ian's forecasted track and potential impacts, no specific guidance is suggested for port and facility operations in Jacksonville, FL, as it appears to be outside of the projected storm surge and heavy rainfall areas. However, it's recommended that facilities maintain normal operations with close monitoring of weather conditions and be prepared to take necessary precautions if advisories or warnings are issued for the area.",Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and all transfer operations may continue while Condition WHISKEY is in effect.
"Based on the forecast, it is likely that the Coast Guard will issue a Notice to Mariners or a Weather Alert Warning for the Jacksonville area within the next 12 hours due to Tropical Storm Ian's expected landfall and potential impact on local waters. This could lead to restricted vessel traffic, cautionary measures, or even a full closure of local waterways to ensure safety.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"Based on the advisory, it is likely that general vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL will be advised to exercise caution and monitor weather conditions closely within the next 24 hours, as Tropical Storm Ian's track and forecasted impacts suggest potential effects on the area's maritime traffic and weather patterns.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"Based on the forecast track and intensity of Tropical Storm Ian, the most likely future operational guidance for general vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL at the time +36h would be to continue monitoring the situation and prepare for potential tropical storm-force winds and rough seas.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"The most likely future operational guidance for general vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL in 48 hours would be to prepare for sustained winds of 30-40 knots (35-46 mph) and seas of 6-8 feet, with a moderate risk of thunderstorms and heavy rain showers affecting the area.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"Based on the forecasted track of Tropical Storm Ian, which does not directly impact Jacksonville, FL, it is expected that no significant changes to vessel traffic or operations would be required at this location within the next 12 hours.
