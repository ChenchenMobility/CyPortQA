"Based on the provided information, the port of Houston, Texas is expected to be significantly impacted by Tropical Storm Beta. The storm is forecasted to make landfall near the central Texas coast and move slowly inland, maintaining tropical storm conditions for an extended period. The port of Houston is within the Tropical Storm Warning area and has a high cumulative probability of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds (52%).

Given the expected impact and the slow movement of the storm, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations may take several days to recover. Considering the time needed for the storm to pass, initial assessments, and resumption of operations, the port of Houston can expect to be disrupted for approximately 5 days.",2.0
