"The primary hazard for Baltimore, MD, related to the storm would be hazardous surf and rip current conditions.",Dangerous rip currents and elevated surf along the Delmarva and New Jersey beaches could disrupt harbor pilot and lightering operations
"There are no additional hazards mentioned for Baltimore, MD.",Enhanced rip currents and rough near-shore seas along the Maryland Atlantic beaches may disrupt pilot transfer and lightering operations.
Rip currents.,High surf and rip currents along the Maryland Atlantic shoreline could disrupt pilot transfers and lightering operations.
Rip current conditions are possible.,"Elevated seas and long-period swells could produce rough Chesapeake Bay and harbor conditions, increasing wave action on exposed berths and restricting small-craft operations."
