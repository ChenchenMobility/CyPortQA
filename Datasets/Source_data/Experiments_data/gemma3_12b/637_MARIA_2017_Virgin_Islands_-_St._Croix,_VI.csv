"This is a fascinating and complex request, blending a variety of elements! Let's break it down and provide a tailored response.

Here's an attempt to answer your question, incorporating the elements you’ve presented.  I'll structure the response in sections to address each of your embedded instructions:

**1. Understanding the Core Question (Initial Prompt)**

Your initial question, *“When is the expected start of impact on freight?”* is open-ended but crucial.  Here's how it's interpreted based on the provided context (Hurricane Maria advisory). Freight impact means the start of disruptions, delays, and complications due to the hurricane.

**2. Leveraging the Hurricane Maria Advisory (Contextual Information)**

The Hurricane Maria advisory is the *critical* source of information. We need to pinpoint the moment the hurricane begins to affect the areas relevant to freight operations.

*   **Areas of Concern:** Freight operations will be impacted in areas under Hurricane Warnings, Tropical Storm Warnings, and Watches.  These include:
    *   Guadeloupe
    *   Dominica
    *   St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat
    *   Martinique
    *   St. Lucia
    *   U.S. Virgin Islands (St. Thomas, St. John, St. Croix)
    *   British Virgin Islands
    *   Anguilla
    *   Barbados
    * St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
*   **Timing – Specifics from the Advisory:**
    *   The advisory states hurricane conditions are *“first expected within portions of the Leeward Islands by late today”* (meaning today, September 18th, 2017).  This implies the *beginning* of freight impact in these areas will start *later today*.
    *   The Advisory also states that conditions will spread through the remainder of the hurricane warning area tonight/Tuesday night.

**3.  Answering the Specific Question with Date & Time Format**

Based on the information from the advisory, the **expected start of the freight impact** can be generalized as follows:

*   **Area (Generalized):** Leeward Islands (including, but not limited to, the listed islands under warning)
*   **Date:** September 18, 2017
*   **Time:** Late Today (general term – will depend on specific location within the Leeward Islands)

**4. Incorporating the Remaining Embedded Instructions**

You've requested a highly specific blend of requirements. Let's integrate them:

*   **Freight Impact:** Hurricane conditions expected to begin late today, impacting freight operations.
*   **Date & Time Format (Specified):** *September 18, 2017.*
*   **""Only with date & time""** Implies there will be a lack of additional information outside of the response.
* **“When is the expected start?”** - Implies this moment is the critical information.

**Final ""Answer"" Meeting ALL Instructions**

"Given the information provided, it's impossible to determine the exact number of commercial vessels impacted. The advisory focuses on hazards (wind, surge, rainfall) and doesn't quantify vessel impacts. However, given the description of a ""dangerous storm surge"" and ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,"" it's reasonable to assume that a significant number of vessels would be affected. Considering the average daily vessel count, a disruption on a scale indicated by this advisory would likely impact more than 20 vessels over the event duration.

Therefore, the answer is **D. 20 vessels or more**.",D.
"A. None



**Explanation:**

The provided text focuses on the hazards associated with Hurricane Maria – wind, storm surge, rainfall, and surf. It doesn't mention any specific impacts on commercial vessels at St. Croix or any estimate of how many vessels might be affected. Therefore, based *solely* on the information given, the most logical answer is that no commercial vessels are predicted to be impacted.",D.
D. 20 vessels or more,D.
,D.
"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Event Duration:** The advisory states the system will affect the Leeward Islands, including St. Croix, starting Monday night and lasting through Tuesday night. That's roughly a 2.5 day event.
*   **Severity:** The advisory highlights ""hurricane conditions possible"" and ""life-threatening flash floods and mudslides."" This indicates a significant impact.
*   **Vessel Impact:** While not explicitly stated, significant weather events like this typically cause vessel delays, diversions, and potential port closures, directly affecting the number of vessels present.
*   **Average Vessels Daily:** The problem states the average daily number of vessels is 5.793428658.

Given the severity and likely disruption, the number of vessels will be significantly reduced. The average is irrelevant, as we are looking at the total impacted number.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**D. 20 vessels or more**",D.
