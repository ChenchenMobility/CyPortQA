"I think there may be some confusion here! The text you provided is a weather forecast for Tropical Storm Colin, and it doesn't mention Boston, MA or any impact on freight.

However, if I had to make an educated guess based on the storm's track and intensity, I'd say the expected start of impact would likely be around 08-09-2016. But please note that this is just a wild guess and not based on any specific data!",6/8/2016
