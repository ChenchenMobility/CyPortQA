"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Texas City, TX within the next 5 days, we need to refer to the probabilities listed for the relevant locations. Texas City, TX is not explicitly listed, but we can use nearby locations such as Galveston, High Island, and Matagorda.

For this example, let's consider High Island, TX as a representative location:

- Day 1: 1%
- Day 2: 4%
- Day 3: 22%
- Day 4: 50%
- Day 5: 64%

The cumulative probability is the sum of these probabilities:

"The provided data does not include Texas City, TX. However, it does include High Island, TX, which is geographically close to Texas City, TX. Using High Island, TX as a proxy:

The cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at High Island, TX within the next 5 days is 14.",21%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Texas City, TX within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities listed for the relevant locations closest to Texas City. Texas City is near Galveston and High Island, TX. We will use the probabilities from High Island, TX, as it is the closest listed location.

The probabilities for 50-kt winds at High Island, TX are:
- Day 1: X (0%)
- Day 2: 2%
- Day 3: 4%
- Day 4: 6%
- Day 5: 9%

To find the cumulative probability, we sum these probabilities:

0% + 2% + 4% + 6% + 9% = 21%

So, the cumulative probability is **21**.",39%
"The data provided does not include Texas City, TX. However, based on the nearest available data points, we can consider the Gulf of Mexico coordinates near Texas City. One of the closest points is GFMX 280N 950W.

- 11 (by 3 days)
- 22 (by 4 days)
- 26 (by 5 days)

Thus, the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at a location near Texas City, TX within the next 5 days is 26.",13%

"The table provided does not list probabilities for Texas City, TX specifically. However, Texas City is located near Galveston Bay and the closest listed points are High Island, TX, and Matagorda, TX.

Given that High Island, TX has a peak 34-kt wind probability of 64 and Matagorda, TX has a peak 34-kt wind probability of 97, it is reasonable to estimate that the peak 34-kt wind probability for Texas City, TX would be between these two values. However, since the exact value is not provided, we cannot give a precise number.

If you need an estimate, you might consider the average of the two closest values:
(64 + 97) / 2 = 80.5

"The provided data does not include specific information for Texas City, TX. However, it does include data for nearby locations such as Galveston (High Island TX) and Freeport TX. Based on the available data:

- High Island TX (near Galveston) has a peak 34-kt wind probability of 29.
- Freeport TX has a peak 34-kt wind probability of 56.

Since Texas City is located between these two locations, a reasonable estimate for the peak 34-kt wind probability at Texas City, TX would be around the mid-range of these values.

"The provided data does not include a specific entry for Texas City, TX. However, it does include data for nearby locations such as High Island, TX, and Galveston, TX. Based on the closest available data, we can infer the highest 34-kt wind probability for Texas City, TX.

Given the data for High Island, the highest 34-kt wind probability for locations near Texas City, TX, occurs in the 12-24 hours interval.

So, the answer is:

B. 12-24 Hours",C.
"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for Texas City, TX, we need to look at the closest relevant location in the provided data, which is Galveston, TX (HIGH ISLAND TX). Here are the probabilities for each time interval:

- 0-12 hours: 5
- 12-24 hours: 16
- 24-48 hours: 11
- 88-100 hours: 8

The highest probability is in the 12-24 hours interval.

B. 12-24 Hours",D.
"The data provided does not include specific wind probability information for Texas City, TX. However, the closest relevant data point is for Galveston, TX (High Island, TX). Based on that, the highest 34-kt wind probability for High Island, TX is within the interval:

D. 48 hours or more",D.
D. 48 hours or more,D.
"To determine if the probability of 34-kt winds at Texas City, TX will reach or exceed 20% at any point during the forecast period, we need to locate Texas City, TX in the provided data. Texas City is not explicitly listed, but we can refer to nearby locations such as Galveston (High Island TX) or Matagorda TX for a reasonable estimate.

From the data:
- **High Island TX (near Galveston)**:
  - Day 1: 2%
  - Day 2: 9%
  - Day 3: 8%
  - Day 4: 10%
  - Day 5: 16%
  - Day 6: 10%
  - Day 7: 1%

- **Matagorda TX**:
  - Day 1: 48%
  - Day 2: 47%
  - Day 3: 1%
  - Day 4: 1%
  - Day 5: 2%
  - Day 6: (Not provided)
  - Day 7: (Not provided)

Given that Matagorda TX shows a probability of 48% on Day 1, which is well above 20%, we can infer that the probability of 34-kt winds in the vicinity of Texas City, TX is likely to reach or exceed 20% at some point during the forecast period.
