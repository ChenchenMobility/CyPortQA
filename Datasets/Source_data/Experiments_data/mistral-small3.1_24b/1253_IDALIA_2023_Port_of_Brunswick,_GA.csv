"The image does not include specific data for the Port of Brunswick, GA. However, based on the general format and typical storm forecasts, you would need to check the relevant time intervals for the highest 34-kt wind probability for the 34-kt wind speed.

Since the question specifically asks for the highest 34-kt wind probability for Port of Brunswick, GA, and the data is not provided, I'll assume the typical structure of such forecasts. Generally, the highest probabilities for wind speeds are indicated in the 24-48 hour interval for many tropical systems.
