"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Reasoning:**

The advisory explicitly mentions ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"" impacting the Florida Keys and the west coast of Florida. Port Everglades is located on the west coast of Florida and is heavily reliant on these conditions for transport. The advisory indicates disruption and potential danger, leading to significant disruption of commercial activity.",D.

"The provided text doesn't offer a specific prediction of impacted commercial vessels at Port Everglades. It discusses rainfall, storm surge, and potential hazards, but doesn's quantify the effect on vessel traffic. Therefore, based solely on the text, there's no way to determine the number of impacted vessels. Given the lack of information, the best possible answer is A.

"A. None



**Explanation:**

The provided text focuses on Elsa's path and potential impacts on Caribbean islands and Cuba. It doesn't mention any specific impacts or disruptions to Port Everglades or commercial vessel traffic.

"A. None



**Explanation:**

The provided text focuses on Elsa's path and potential impacts on the Caribbean, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Cuba, and surrounding areas. There's **no mention whatsoever** of Port Everglades, Florida, or any anticipated impact on its commercial vessel traffic. Therefore, the predicted impact is none.",D.

"Based on the Elsa forecast, general vessel activity at Port Everglades should prepare for potential disruptions early next week due to rainfall and possible flooding, and monitor advisories from local weather offices for updates on surf and rip current conditions. It's prudent to be aware of potential impacts and adjust operations accordingly.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of the arrival of hazardous winds should seek an alternate port.
,"Vessels wishing to remain must contact the Captain of the Port, obtain permission, and submit a written safe-mooring plan; drawbridges may not operate once sustained winds reach 25 mph or during an evacuation; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida that cannot offload and depart within 24 hours before threatening winds should seek an alternate port."

"Given Elsa's forecast track and potential for impacts as a tropical storm early next week, Port Everglades should monitor conditions closely and prepare for potential disruptions, including securing cargo and reviewing contingency plans for vessel operations and facility access. It's crucial to stay updated on forecasts and heed any watches or warnings issued by the National Hurricane Center and local authorities.",Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and all cargo transfer operations may continue.
"Given that Elsa has weakened and is no longer a significant threat to Florida, Port Everglades can resume normal operations. However, facilities should remain vigilant and monitor for any unexpected changes in the storm's path or intensity.",Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and transfer operations may continue while Port Condition WHISKEY is in effect.

,Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of the arrival of hazardous winds should seek an alternate port.
"Given that Hurricane Elsa is forecast to move near Jamaica and Cuba and potentially impact the Cayman Islands, and with a forecast track potentially bringing it near Florida, commercial vessel activity at Port Everglades will likely be subject to increased monitoring and potential delays or restrictions. Operators will be advised to track the storm's progress and prepare for potential disruptions to schedules and route adjustments to ensure safety.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of the arrival of hazardous winds should seek an alternate port.
"Given that Hurricane Elsa is forecast to move near Jamaica and Cuba within 24 hours, and the advisory highlights potential impacts on the wider Caribbean region, Port Everglades will likely experience heightened awareness and potential operational adjustments. This could include increased monitoring of weather conditions, possible restrictions on vessel movements, and heightened preparedness for potential disruptions.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of the arrival of hazardous winds should seek an alternate port.
