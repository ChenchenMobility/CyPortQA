"The data provided does not include information for the Port of Brunswick, GA. Therefore, I cannot calculate the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival for that specific location based on the given information.",50%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at the Port of Brunswick, GA within the next 5 days, we need to identify the relevant data points from the provided forecast.

However, the Port of Brunswick, GA is not explicitly listed in the forecast data. The closest relevant locations are Savannah, GA, and Kings Bay, GA. We can use the data from these locations to estimate the probability for the Port of Brunswick, GA.

For Savannah, GA:
- Day 1: 1%
- Day 2: 1%
- Day 3: 23%
- Day 4: 1%
- Day 5: 0%

For Kings Bay, GA:
- Day 1: 3%
- Day 2: 32%
- Day 3: 0%
- Day 4: 0%
- Day 5: 0%

To estimate the cumulative probability for the Port of Brunswick, GA, we can average the probabilities from Savannah, GA, and Kings Bay, GA for each day:

- Day 1: (1% + 3%) / 2 = 2%
- Day 2: (1% + 32%) / 2 = 16.5%
- Day 3: (23% + 0%) / 2 = 11.5%
- Day 4: (1% + 0%) / 2 = 0.5%
- Day 5: (0% + 0%) / 2 = 0%

Now, we sum these probabilities to get the cumulative probability over the next 5 days:

2% + 16.5% + 11.5% + 0.5% + 0% = 30.5%

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at the Port of Brunswick, GA within the next 5 days is approximately:

"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for Port of Brunswick, GA, we need to look for the location of Brunswick, GA in the provided forecast data. Since Brunswick, GA is not explicitly listed, we need to find the nearest relevant location. The closest data point provided is ""MAYPORT NS FL"" and ""JACKSONVILLE"", which are geographically close to Brunswick, GA.

For MAYPORT NS FL:
- 0-12 hours: 81
- 12-24 hours: 85
- 24-48 hours: X
- 48 hours or more: X

For JACKSONVILLE:
- 0-12 hours: 83
- 12-24 hours: 85
- 24-48 hours: X
- 48 hours or more: X

Given these probabilities, the highest 34-kt wind probability for the 12-24 hour interval is 85 for both MAYPORT NS FL and JACKSONVILLE.

Therefore, the highest 34-kt wind probability for Port of Brunswick, GA is indicated in the 12-24 hour interval.

**Answer: B**",B.
"The data for Port of Brunswick, GA is not explicitly provided in the text. However, there is information for nearby locations such as Kings Bay, GA, and Waycross, GA. Given that these locations are relatively close, we can use their data to infer the wind probabilities for the Port of Brunswick, GA.

For Kings Bay, GA:
- 0-12 hours: 1
- 12-24 hours: 43
- 24-48 hours: 6
- 48 hours or more: X

For Waycross, GA:
- 0-12 hours: 1
- 12-24 hours: 39
- 24-48 hours: 4
- 48 hours or more: X

The highest 34-kt wind probability for both Kings Bay and Waycross occurs in the 12-24 hour interval. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the highest 34-kt wind probability for the Port of Brunswick, GA would also be in the 12-24 hour interval.

B. 12-24 Hours",B.
"To determine which forecasted time interval indicates the highest 34-kt wind probability for Port of Brunswick, GA, we need to locate the relevant data in the provided forecast.

1. Locate ""Brunwick, GA"" in the forecast data. Unfortunately, Brunswick, GA, is not explicitly listed. However, we can use nearby locations like Kings Bay, GA, and Jacksonville, FL, to infer the conditions.

2. Check the 34-kt wind probabilities for these nearby locations:
   - **Kings Bay, GA**:
     - 0-12 hours: X (0%)
     - 12-24 hours: 3 (3%)
     - 24-48 hours: 32 (32%)
     - 48 hours or more: X (0% not provided)
   - **Jacksonville, FL**:
     - 0-12 hours: X (0%)
     - 12-24 hours: 4 (4%)
     - 24-48 hours: 30 (30%)
     - 48 hours or more: % not provided

3. Based on the highest probability for 34-kt winds in the nearby locations, we can see that the highest probability for Kings Bay, GA is in the 24-48 hours interval with 32%.

Therefore, the highest 34-kt wind probability for Port of Brunswick, GA, is likely to be in the same interval as Kings Bay, GA.
