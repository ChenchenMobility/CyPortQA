DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Subtropical Storm Melissa
was located near latitude 38.5 North, longitude 69.6 West. Melissa
is moving toward the south-southwest near 3 mph (6 km/h), but
little net motion is expected today. A turn toward the east-
northeast with an increase in forward speed is forecast tonight and
this motion will continue through the weekend. On the forecast
track, the center of Melissa will move away from the east coast of
the United States.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected over the next couple of days,
and Melissa is forecast to lose its subtropical characteristics by
Saturday night.

Winds of 40 mph extend outward up to 345 miles (555 km) from the
center, primarily over waters.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Wind gusts to 50 mph are likely to continue over portions of
Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket through much of today.

COASTAL FLOODING:  Coastal flooding will continue today along
portions of the U.S. east coast from the mid-Atlantic states to
southeastern New England.

SURF:  Swells generated by Melissa are affecting much of the U.S.
east coast, portions of the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada.
These swells will result in life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
