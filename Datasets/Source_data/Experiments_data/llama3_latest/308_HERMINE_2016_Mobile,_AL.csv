"Isolated tornadoes are possible overnight near Mobile, Alabama, as a result of Hermine's interaction with the warm Gulf waters.",Brief marine squalls could create short-lived reduced visibility for vessel traffic
Tornadoes are possible late tonight into Thursday morning mainly across southern Alabama.,Low tornado risk and minor lightning from outer bands; operational disruption minimal but monitor for squalls.
"Flooding is expected along the Mobile Bay shoreline due to the potential for heavy freshwater runoff from inland areas, exacerbated by high tide.",Rough Gulf seas and elevated wave action could affect pilot transfers and berth operations.
"Isolated tornadoes could form near the coast of Alabama as the cyclone approaches, posing a threat to life and property.",Elevated rip-current risk along Alabama beaches
Isolated tornadoes are possible along the coast of Alabama if the storm strengthens into a tropical cyclone.,Minor marine/operational disruptions possible from increased swells and scattered squalls.
Tornadoes,None anticipated that would significantly disrupt port operations
Isolated tornadoes are possible over eastern Alabama on Tuesday into Wednesday as the system's forward speed decreases and its circulation becomes more complex.,Elevated seas and rip currents in the near-shore approaches beginning mid-week may hamper small-craft operations.
