"The image does not provide coordinates for the current eye of the tropical cyclone. It's a map showing the track and forecast cone of a hurricane. If you are looking for specific details about the hurricane, please provide the context or question, and I can assist you with that information.","32.9N, 78.3W"
"The image you provided shows a tropical cyclone track forecast cone from the National Hurricane Center, which is a graphical representation of where a storm is expected to move over time. It does not provide the current eye position coordinates in the format you requested.

The map includes various information such as the name of the storm (which looks like Ana), its current location, and an indication of which state might be impacted next. The map also shows the wind speeds at different points along the forecast track, indicating the intensity of the storm.

To find the current eye position coordinates, you would need to refer to the latest advisory or update from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), which will provide the most accurate and up-to-date information on the cyclone's location and strength.","32.4N, 77.6W"
"The image depicts a weather map showing a tropical cyclone named ""Sandra."" The current eye of the tropical cyclone, as indicated on the map, is located at the coordinates '32.4N, 77.6W'. However, it is important to note that this information may change as the storm evolves.

However, without more information or context about the image, it is not possible for me to determine the coordinates of the current eye of the tropical cyclone shown in this image accurately.

For such information, I would need access to real-time weather data or a specific date on a storm tracker, which would allow me to provide an accurate answer. If you have access to this type of data, feel free to provide it, and I'll do my best to assist you.","31.5N, 77.6W"
