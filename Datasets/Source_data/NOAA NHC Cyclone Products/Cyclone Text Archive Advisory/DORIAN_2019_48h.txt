DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Dorian was located
near latitude 33.4 North, longitude 78.0 West.  Dorian is moving
toward the northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue with an increase in forward speed through
Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Dorian will move
near or over the coast of North Carolina tonight and Friday. The
center should move to the southeast of extreme southeastern New
England Friday night and Saturday morning, and approach Nova Scotia
later Saturday or Saturday night.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that maximum sustained winds are now near 100 mph (160
km/h) with higher gusts.  Slow weakening is expected during the next
few days. However, Dorian is expected to remain a powerful hurricane
as the center moves near the coasts of South and North Carolina.
Dorian is forecast to become a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone
by Saturday night as it approaches Nova Scotia.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220
miles (350 km). Frying Pan Shoals just reported a peak gust of 70
mph (113 km/h).

The minimum central pressure based on Hurricane Hunter aircraft
data is 964 mb (28.47 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are beginning to spread along portions
of the North Carolina coast. Tropical storm conditions are still
affecting the northern portion of the South Carolina coast.

Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Tropical Storm
Warning area in the Mid-Atlantic states by Friday and over
portions of extreme southeastern Massachusetts by late Friday or
early Saturday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Cape Fear to Duck NC, including Pamlico and Albemarle
Sounds and the Neuse and Pamlico Rivers...4 to 7 ft
Duck NC to Poquoson VA, including Hampton Roads...2 to 4 ft

Water levels could begin to rise well in advance of the arrival of
strong winds.  The surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the how close
the center of Dorian comes to the coast, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

RAINFALL: Dorian is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals through Friday:

Coastal Carolinas...6 to 12 inches, isolated 15 inches
Far southeast Virginia...3 to 8 inches
Extreme southeastern New England...2 to 4 inches

This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods.

SURF:  Large swells will affect the northwestern Bahamas, and
the entire southeastern United States coast from Florida through
North Carolina during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

TORNADOES:  Tornadoes are possible through early Friday across
eastern North Carolina into southeast Virginia.
