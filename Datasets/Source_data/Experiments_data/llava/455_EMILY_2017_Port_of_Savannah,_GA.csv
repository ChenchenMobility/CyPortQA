"The image you've provided appears to be a weather bulletin from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). It mentions Tropical Depression Six and its potential impact on various locations along the west coast of Florida, including Tampa Bay and Naples.

Regarding your specific question about when the expected start of impact on freight at Port of Savannah, GA would occur, I'm unable to provide you with an exact date as my current training data only goes up to 2021, and I don't have access to real-time data or updates. The NHC advisory does not mention Port of Savannah directly, so it's difficult to predict how tropical depression Six could affect the Port of Savannah without additional information.

To get accurate and timely information about potential weather impacts on freight at the Port of Savannah, you should consult local news sources, the NHC website, or contact the port directly for specific information regarding their operations and safety protocols during such weather events.",None
