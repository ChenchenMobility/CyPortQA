As for your question about the port's freight, I am unable to provide specific information on the impact of the storm on a particular port's freight without more context or a clearer image with additional details. However, in general, a hurricane or other severe weather can disrupt port operations and delay or halt freight movement, potentially affecting the supply chain and causing economic impacts.
