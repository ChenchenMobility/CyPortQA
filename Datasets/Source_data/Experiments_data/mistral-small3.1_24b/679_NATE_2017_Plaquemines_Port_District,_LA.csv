"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days, we need to identify the relevant location in the provided data. Plaquemines Port District, LA is not explicitly listed, but we can use nearby locations to estimate the probability.

The closest relevant locations are:
- NEW ORLEANS LA
- GULFPORT MS (not listed, but nearby)
- MORGAN CITY LA

We will use the probabilities from NEW ORLEANS LA and MORGAN CITY LA to estimate the probability for Plaquemines Port District, LA.

From the data:
- NEW ORLEANS LA: 2 (cumulative probability for 34-kt winds)
- MORGAN CITY LA: 3 (cumulative probability for 34-kt winds)

Since Plaquemines Port District is roughly between these two locations, we can take an average of their probabilities to estimate the probability for Plaquemines Port District.

\[
\text{Average probability} = \frac{2 + 3}{2} = 2.5
\]

However, since we need to provide a number without any units or additional information, we round this to the nearest whole number:

\[
2.5 \approx 3
\]

So, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days is:

3",34%
18,21%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days, we need to locate the relevant data in the provided forecast.

1. Identify the location: Plaquemines Port District, LA is not explicitly listed, but New Orleans, LA is nearby and can be used as a proxy.
2. Find the 50-kt wind probability for New Orleans, LA:
   - New Orleans, LA 50-kt wind probability: 1%

Thus, the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days is:

1",14%
0.06,8%
48,96
12,120
"The data provided does not specify the exact timing for when the 50-kt wind probability peaks at Plaquemines Port District, LA. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the number of hours remaining until the peak based on the given information.",96
