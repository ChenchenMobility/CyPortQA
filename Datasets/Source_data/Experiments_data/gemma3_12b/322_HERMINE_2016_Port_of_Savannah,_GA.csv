"Okay, this is a really long and messy data set! It appears to be a collection of data points (likely wind speed or some other measurement) taken at various locations, likely across the southeastern United States and surrounding areas. Let's break down what's requested and then I'll address the issues with the data.

**Understanding the Request**

The core request is:

1.  **Find the 2nd Cumulative Data Point:**  This is likely the measurement at the *second* location in the data set.
2.  **Identify the 2nd Measurement:** This would be the value associated with that location in the original dataset.
3. **Find Data for Savannah GA within 2 days**: This appears to look for measurements for Savannah, Georgia within a 2 day window.

**Addressing the Data Issues**

Before I can do this, the biggest issue is the data itself. It's incredibly difficult to parse because:

*   **Inconsistent Formatting:** The spacing, labels, and values are highly inconsistent.
*   **Missing Values:** The ""X"" represents missing values.
*   **Labeling Complexity:** The location labels are a mix of names, coordinates, and abbreviations.
* **Lack of Units**: We don't know what the measurements are.
* **Very Long and Messy:** Manually parsing this would be extraordinarily time-consuming and error-prone.

**What I can do (and limitations)**

I can attempt to extract the data if you can specify a clear pattern or a more structured version.  I can provide a more helpful analysis if you can clarify:

*   **What is being measured?** (Wind speed, temperature, etc.)
*   **Units?** (mph, km/h, Celsius, Fahrenheit, etc.)
*   **Structure:** Is there a way to reliably distinguish between locations, measurements, and missing values?

**Assuming a basic structure to try and address the first part of the question**

I'll *assume* the locations are listed in order, and try to extract the second data point:

1.  **Second Location:** Let's assume the ""GFMX 290N 850W"" is the second location.

2. **Value Associated With The 2nd Data point**: From looking at the 2nd line of the list provided, it would appear that the measurement at the 2nd location is ""2""

**Finding Savannah GA within 2 Days**
The values associated with Savannah, GA, are inconsistent. It is difficult to determine measurements for Savannah, Georgia, and also difficult to determine within a 2 day window. 

To get a more accurate answer, please supply the missing information about the data format, structure, and units.",33%

"Given the provided text, there's absolutely no information about the Port of Savannah, GA, or any impact on commercial vessels there. The text focuses entirely on Tropical Depression Nine and its potential impacts on Cuba and Florida.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A. None**.",C.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

Here's why:

*   **Significant Rainfall:** The advisory predicts 1-4 inches of rain over southern Florida and the Florida Keys, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches. This level of rainfall will impact maritime operations, causing delays and potentially restricting access to ports.
*   **Potential for Delays and Restrictions:** Even if vessels aren't directly hit by strong winds, heavy rain and potential flooding can disrupt loading, unloading, and overall port efficiency.
*   **Port of Savannah Vulnerability:** The Port of Savannah, being in a coastal area susceptible to heavy rainfall, is likely to experience disruptions impacting a significant number of vessels.
*   **Average Daily Volume:** With an average daily volume of over 15 vessels, a disruption leading to delays and potential rerouting would easily push the total impacted number beyond 20.",C.
B. 1-10 vessels,C.
