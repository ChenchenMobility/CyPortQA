Flooding,Increased swells and rip currents may disrupt port and near-shore operations
"The image shows an NWS National Hurricane Center bulletin for Tropical Depression Six, highlighting its current position near Bermuda, forecasted movement towards the northeast, and potential transition to a tropical storm. It also mentions maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1008 mb (29.77 inches). The bulletin emphasizes that there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect at the moment and will provide an update at 1100 PM EDT.",Long-period swells and strong rip currents along Virginia beaches may affect small-craft operations.
None,High surf and dangerous rip currents along adjacent Virginia beaches could affect port traffic
Flooding,"Long-period swells and higher seas could affect harbor approaches and pilot boarding areas beginning late Tuesday, creating hazardous navigation for small craft"

Note: The probabilities are given in terms of onset probability and cumulative probability. For example, ""3(X)"" means a 3% chance that the gale force winds will begin during the specified time period, and a 1% chance that they will persist through the entire period. Similarly, ""7(7)"" means a 7% chance of gale force winds at some point during the 96-hour period, with a 1% cumulative probability.

The table provided in the text shows the probabilities for various locations and time periods within the next 5 days. The table is not fully visible in the image, but it seems to include locations such as Ile St Pierre, Burgeo NFLD, PTX Basques, Eddy Point NS, Sydney NS, Sable Island, Halifax NS, Yarmouth NS, Moncton NB, Eastport ME, Hyannis MA, and Nantucket MA. The probabilities for each location and time period are given in terms of sustained wind speed classes (e.g., 34 kt, 50 kt, or 64 kt), with ""X"" indicating that the probability is less than 1%.

The discussion and outlook section of the advisory provides information on the current state of Tropical Storm Erin and its expected movement and intensification. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches), which suggests that the storm may weaken in the coming days.

The next advisory will be issued at 1100 AM EDT.","{'in 12h': '5%', 'in 24h': '10%', 'in 48h': '5%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '0%'}"
