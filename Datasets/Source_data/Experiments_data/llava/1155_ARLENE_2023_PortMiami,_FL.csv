According to the forecast, Arlene is expected to move toward the south-southeast near 7 mph (11 km/h) with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The storm is predicted to weaken by tonight and degenerate into a remnant low on Saturday. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with localized higher amounts up to 6 inches are expected across portions of the central and southern Florida Peninsula, which could lead to isolated flash, urban, and small stream flooding impacts.
