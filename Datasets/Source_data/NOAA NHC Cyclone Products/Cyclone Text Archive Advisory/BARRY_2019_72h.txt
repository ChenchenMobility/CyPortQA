HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the

rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Mouth of the Pearl River to Morgan City...3 to 5 ft

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 6 to 12 inches near and inland of the central Gulf

amounts of 18 inches.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by late Thursday or early Friday.
