"The image you've provided appears to be a weather map from the National Weather Service, which includes a track forecast cone for a storm system in the Gulf of Mexico. While this type of information can be crucial for understanding and predicting the path of such storms, it is important to note that specific details about the current eye of a tropical cyclone, such as its exact position, are not typically included in such maps. Instead, they typically show the projected track of the storm system over time, which is indicated by various lines and symbols on the map.

In this case, the text ""Potential Tropical Cyclone"" at the bottom of the image suggests that the meteorologists are monitoring a disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico, but there is no explicit mention of an eye or any other specific details about its current position. The map shows potential wind speeds and probability of tropical cyclone formation, but without additional information, it's not possible to provide the exact coordinates of the current eye of the tropical cyclone.","22.9N, 92.4W"

"The image you provided shows a weather forecast advisory for a potential tropical storm named ""Potential Tropical Cyclone Three."" It is expected to make landfall along the northern Gulf Coast tonight or early Saturday, with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 km/h) and heavy rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches across portions of the Central Gulf Coast. The advisory also indicates that the system is moving toward the north near 16 mph (26 km/h) and will continue on a northeast or east-northeast motion after landfall.",None
"The image does not contain any information about the predicted peak impact on freight at South Jersey Port Corp, NJ.",None
"The image shows a bulletin from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) regarding Potential Tropical Cyclone Three. It mentions that a tropical storm warning is in effect for the Gulf Coast from Intracoastal City, Louisiana, to the Alabama/Florida border, including Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and Metropolitan New Orleans. The forecast track indicates that the system will approach the north-central Gulf coast late Friday or early Saturday. Heavy rainfall of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches are possible in these areas through the weekend. A subtropical or tropical depression or storm is expected to form over the west-central Gulf of Mexico tonight or early Friday, and a formation chance through 48 hours is high at 90 percent. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches). The bulletin also notes that storm surge will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline, and mentions that tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the warning area on Friday, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.",None
"The expected end of impact on freight at South Jersey Port Corp, NJ is not specifically stated in the image you provided. However, based on the information available in the advisory, the storm is forecast to make landfall along the north-central Gulf Coast tonight or early Saturday. Considering that South Jersey Port Corp is located far away from the Gulf Coast, it is likely that any impact on freight at the port would be minimal and short-lived. Therefore, one could reasonably assume that the end of impact would occur soon after the storm has made landfall and moved inland, which might be around 48 to 72 hours after the landfall, or sometime between Saturday night and Monday morning. Without more specific information on the track and intensity of the storm, it is difficult to give a more precise answer.",None

"The image you have provided appears to be a weather forecast and advisory bulletin from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for a potential tropical cyclone named 'Potential Tropical Cyclone Three'. It is important to note that this information is valid only up until the time it was issued, which in this case is 4:00 PM Central Daylight Time on Thursday, June 17, 2021.

In terms of your question about when the expected end of impact on freight at South Jersey Port Corp will occur, without knowing the exact date and time the forecast was issued, I cannot provide an answer. However, according to the NHC advisory, the potential tropical cyclone is expected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to the northern Gulf Coast, including Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and Metropolitan New Orleans. The specific timing for any impacts on freight at South Jersey Port Corp would depend on the track and intensity of the storm, which could change as it approaches the coast.

If you are looking for a weather forecast or information about the current conditions at the South Jersey Port Corp, I recommend checking the latest updates from the National Weather Service or local weather forecasts for that specific location.",None
