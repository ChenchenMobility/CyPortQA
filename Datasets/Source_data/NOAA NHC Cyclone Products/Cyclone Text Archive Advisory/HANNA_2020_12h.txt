A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline,
during the next 24 hours in the indicated locations. For a depiction
of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.  This is a

to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hanna was located 
by reconnaissance aircraft and NOAA Doppler weather radars near 
latitude 27.1 North, longitude 96.0 West.  Hanna is moving toward 
the west near 9 mph (15 km), and this motion should continue through 
this morning.  A gradual turn toward the west-southwest is expected 
by tonight and that motion should continue through Sunday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Hanna should make landfall along the 
Texas coast within the hurricane warning area this afternoon or 
early this evening.
 
Data from the reconnaissance aircraft and Doppler weather radars
indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph
(120 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast
before Hanna makes landfall later today. Rapid weakening is expected
after Hanna moves inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (40 km) from
the center. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km) from the center.
 
Data from the NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the
minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hanna can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Port Mansfield to Baffin Bay TX...2 to 4 ft
 
Baffin Bay to Sargent TX...including Corpus Christi Bay, Copano Bay,
Aransas Bay, San Antonio Bay, and Matagorda Bay...3 to 5 ft
 
Mouth of the Rio Grande to Port Mansfield TX...1 to 3 ft
 
North of Sargent to High Island TX...including Galveston Bay...1 to
2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the landfall location.  Surge-related flooding depends
on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can
vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area
this afternoon.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin
in the warning area later this morning.
 
RAINFALL: Hanna is expected to produce 6 to 12 inches of rain with
isolated maximum totals of 18 inches through Sunday night in south
Texas and into the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and
northern Tamaulipas.  This rain may result in life-threatening flash
flooding, rapid rises on small streams, and isolated minor to
moderate river flooding in south Texas.
 
3 to 5 inches of rain is expected along the upper Texas and
Louisiana coasts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Hanna are expected to increase and affect
much of the Texas and Louisiana coasts during the next couple of
days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible today and overnight over
parts of the lower to middle Texas coastal plain.
