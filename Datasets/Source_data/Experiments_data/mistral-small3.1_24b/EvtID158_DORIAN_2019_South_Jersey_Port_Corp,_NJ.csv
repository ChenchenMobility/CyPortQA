"The South Jersey Port Corp, NJ, is closest to the NWS EARLE NJ entry in the data. For NWS EARLE NJ, the highest 34-kt wind probability is indicated in the 48 hours or more interval with a value of 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
D. 48 hours or more",B.
"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for South Jersey Port Corp, NJ, we need to identify the relevant location in the provided data. The closest entry to South Jersey Port Corp, NJ, in the data is ""ATLANTIC CITY MUNICIPAL AIR"".

Looking at the probabilities for ATLANTIC CITY MUNICIPALIR:
- 0-12 hours: X(99)
- 1-3 hours: X(99)
- 3-6 hours: X(99)
- 6-12 hours: X(99)
- 12-24 hours: 2(99)
- 24-48 hours: X(99)
- 48 hours or more: X(99)

The highest probability listed is in the 12-24 hours interval with a value of 2(99).

Therefore, the answer is:

B. 12-24 Hours",B.
