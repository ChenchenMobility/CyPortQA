"There are no additional hazards associated with the possible future storm at PortMiami, FL.",Low tornado threat confined to north Florida and southeast Georgia – not expected near PortMiami.
None.,Increased rip-current risk and higher surf along the southeast Florida beaches Thursday–Friday.
Additional hazards could include increased risk of boat damage or accidents due to rough seas and strong winds.,Isolated tornado risk mainly across central–north Florida; not expected in the Miami area
The image is of a cyclone track forecast cone and cyclone public advisory from National Hurricane Center for Tropical Depression Nine.,Isolated tornadoes or waterspouts possible in outer rain-bands; brief interruptions to port operations from heavy rain and squalls
"The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast map. This particular image is dated August 30, 2016, at 4:00 PM CDT (5:00 UTC), and it shows Tropical Depression Nine as the main area of interest. The storm has a central pressure of 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

The map includes an overlay of a cone, which represents the forecasted path of the storm according to the most likely scenario, the ""best guess."" This particular map shows that Tropical Depression Nine is moving toward the northwest and is expected to turn toward the north-northeast on Wednesday.

The areas affected by this storm include a hurricane watch for the Florida Gulf coast from Anclote River to Indian Pass, and a tropical storm watch for the Florida Gulf coast west of Indian Pass to the Walton/Bay County line. This means that residents in these areas should be prepared for possible hurricane conditions within the next 48 hours.

Please note that the specific hazards associated with a future storm at PortMiami, FL, would depend on the exact path and intensity of the storm. As the map indicates, there is potential for wind, storm surge, and rainfall in this region. For accurate and up-to-date information, one should always refer to the latest official forecasts from the National Hurricane Center.","Brief tornadoes in outer bands cannot be ruled out, and elevated seas/short-period swell could disrupt pilot transfers and container-handling operations."
No image provided for this question.,Dangerous rip currents along the southeast Florida beaches and a low tornado risk in outer rain-bands.
The possible future storm may cause flooding due to a high tide event at PortMiami.,Localized street flooding and reduced visibility may disrupt port and road operations
Flooding from storm surge,Hazardous seas and rip currents for vessels entering/exiting Government Cut; localized street flooding during peak downpours.
No additional hazards are depicted in the image provided.,Ponding on terminal yards and roadway flooding may disrupt port truck traffic.

Tropical depressions usually peak in intensity before making landfall or before dissipating as they travel over water. As the tropical depression approaches PortMiami, there may be an increase in wind speed and storm surge levels, which could impact freight operations at the port. If this particular system is forecast to make a direct hit on Florida, it might cause significant disruptions to cargo handling, shipping schedules, and overall port operations for several days after the peak impact.
