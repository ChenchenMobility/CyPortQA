This is because the advisory indicates that there is a possibility of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the coastline within the next 48 hours. The storm is expected to continue its slow westward motion and approach the Texas coast early next week, with the potential for strengthening conditions. It is important to note that the exact duration of any disruptions may depend on the specific path of the storm and local weather conditions.",3
