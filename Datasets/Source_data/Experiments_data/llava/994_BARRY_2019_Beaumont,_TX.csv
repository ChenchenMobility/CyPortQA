If you're asking about the current location of the center of a storm in a forecast cone, it is typically shown as the point where the lines converge on the image. This point would represent the central position of the storm and is the area that is expected to experience the most severe weather conditions.

However, the information you're looking for about the current eye of the tropical cyclone isn't visible in this image. It would be found in an accompanying forecast track map, which you can access from the National Hurricane Center or other official meteorological services.","28.5N, 86.4W"
