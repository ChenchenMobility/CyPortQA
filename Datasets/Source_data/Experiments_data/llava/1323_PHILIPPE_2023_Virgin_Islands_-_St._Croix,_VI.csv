"I'm sorry, but as an AI, I do not have access to current data on the location of a specific tropical cyclone's eye. However, I can give you information about how tropical cyclones are typically tracked and forecasted using maps and charts such as those provided by the National Hurricane Center (NHC).

Tropical cyclones are monitored through satellite imagery, radar data, and surface observations from ships and aircraft. This information is used to create forecast tracks that show the expected future position of the cyclone. The National Hurricane Center releases these forecast tracks as part of its official advisories for tropical cyclones.

The map you provided appears to be a screenshot of a track forecast cone from the NHC, which is typically used to show the possible future paths of a tropical cyclone. This information is based on the latest satellite imagery, atmospheric model forecasts, and other relevant meteorological data. The specific coordinates within this cone represent the expected future positions of the tropical cyclone at various times into the future.

It's important to note that these forecast tracks are not always accurate and can change as new information becomes available. As a result, it is crucial for those in the affected areas to monitor official sources such as the NHC and local weather services for the latest updates on tropical cyclones.","18.8N, 54.6W"

"The given table does not provide the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI. However, based on the available information, we can calculate the onset and 5-day cumulative probabilities of 34-kt and 64-kt winds for the given location and time periods.

For 34-kt winds:
- Onset probability between 06Z FRI and 18Z FRI: X( X)
- Onset probability between 18Z FRI and 06Z SAT: X( X)
- Onset probability between 06Z SAT and 18Z SAT: X( X)

- Onset probability between 06Z SUN and 06Z MON: 2( 3)
- Onset probability between 06Z MON and 06Z TUE: X( 3)
- Cumulative probability between 06Z FRI and 18Z WED: 5( 7) (assuming each onset probability is multiplied by the corresponding number of hours in each time period)

For 64-kt winds:
- Onset probability between 06Z FRI and 18Z FRI: X( X)
- Onset probability between 18Z FRI and 06Z SAT: X( X)
- Onset probability between 06Z SAT and 18Z SAT: X( X)

- Cumulative probability between 06Z FRI and 18Z WED: 7( 9) (assuming each onset probability is multiplied by the corresponding number of hours in each time period)

To calculate the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival, we would need to add up the onset probabilities between 06Z FRI and 18Z WED for the given location and time periods. However, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine the exact number of hours in each time period or whether the onset probabilities are multiplied by the corresponding number of hours in each time period.
