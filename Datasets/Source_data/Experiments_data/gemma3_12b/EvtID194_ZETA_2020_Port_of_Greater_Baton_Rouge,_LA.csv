Tornadoes are a potential hazard.,"Isolated tornadoes, scattered power outages, debris on access roads, temporary closure of Mississippi River navigation during peak winds"
Navigation hazards may arise due to reduced visibility and potential for debris in the waterways.,A few brief tornadoes possible in surrounding parishes Wednesday evening as outer rain bands move inland.
"Potential hazards include localized flooding, navigational hazards, and disruption of utility services.",Brief tornado risk Wednesday–Wednesday night; possible river level rise on the lower Mississippi affecting terminal operations
"Potential hazards include disruptions to shipping schedules, facility damage, and power outages.",Brief tornadoes in outer rain bands and possible short-term river flooding that could disrupt cargo and landside transportation.
River flooding is a potential hazard.,Brief river current increase and floating debris could hinder navigation immediately after heavy rainfall.
River flooding.,"Temporary closure of the Mississippi River to deep-draft traffic, possible barge breakaways, and power outages affecting cargo handling equipment."
River flooding and disruptions to maritime traffic are potential hazards.,Possible brief tornadoes in outer rain bands and operational disruptions from prolonged rains and gusty winds.
Navigational hazards may arise from debris and altered channel depths.,Brief tornadoes in outer rainbands and debris-flow or bank instability along the Mississippi River are possible during peak winds and heavy rain.

"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The forecast discusses heavy rainfall and potential flooding impacting the Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA. Given the discussion of potential flooding and the forecast for significant rainfall, it's reasonable to anticipate a disruption to port operations and a potential impact on the number of vessels able to operate. Given that there is heavy rainfall and significant risk of flood, it is safe to conclude that the number of vessels would be 20 or more.",D.
C,D.
"A. None



**Explanation:**

The forecast discusses rainfall impacting areas including eastern Louisiana, but doesn't specifically mention the Port of Greater Baton Rouge. Given that the port is inland and the main focus is on coastal impacts, it’s reasonable to assume minimal direct impact to commercial vessel operations.",D.
