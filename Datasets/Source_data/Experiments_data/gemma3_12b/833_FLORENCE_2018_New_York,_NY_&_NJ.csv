    *   Will maintain hurricane strength through Thursday.
*   **Hazards:**  Large swells affecting Bermuda and portions of the US east coast.
*   **Forecaster:** Blake

**Summary:**

Hurricane Florence is currently a powerful hurricane located southeast of Bermuda. It is expected to rapidly intensify into a major hurricane and travel west/west-northwest, potentially impacting Bermuda and then the southeastern United States coastline within the next few days. It is expected to remain a powerful hurricane. Areas in the expected path should monitor its progress.

**Additional Observations:**

*   **Scientific Language:** The advisory is written in technical language common in meteorological reports.
*   **Sequential Updates:** Hurricane advisories are updated frequently as the storm's characteristics change.

"I am unable to answer this question. The provided text does not contain information about commercial vessels at New York, NY & NJ. It focuses on Hurricane Florence's impacts on coastal areas, storm surge, rainfall, and potential tornadoes. Therefore, I cannot estimate the number of impacted vessels based on this text.",D.
"A. None



**Explanation:**

The provided text describes Hurricane Florence and its potential impacts on the southeastern US coastline. It doesn't mention any specific impacts on ports like New York or New Jersey. Therefore, based solely on the given information, there's no indication of any commercial vessel disruptions in that area.",D.
"Based on the provided text, there is **no information** about the number of commercial vessels at New York, NY & NJ. The text focuses on Hurricane Florence and its impacts on coastal areas, not port activity.

Therefore, it's impossible to answer the question based on the given information. However, I am forced to choose one of the options, and in these cases, I will default to **A. None**",D.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Explanation:**

The advisory mentions ""tides and swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"" impacting areas including the U.S. East Coast. New York and New Jersey are part of this area, and the disruption could lead to significant delays or cancellations of vessel traffic. Given the severity of the storm and the potential for delays, it is highly probable that the number of affected commercial vessels would exceed 20.",D.

"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Reasoning:**

The Florence advisory explicitly mentions ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"" affecting the U.S. East Coast. New York and New Jersey are part of that East Coast. Given the severity of the storm and the potential for disruptions to shipping, it's highly likely that a significant number of vessels would be affected, leading to delays or avoidance of the area. While a precise number is impossible to determine from the advisory, ""20 vessels or more"" is the most plausible estimate within the given choices, reflecting the potential for substantial disruption to maritime traffic.",D.
