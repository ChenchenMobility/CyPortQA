"Wilmington, DE is not mentioned in the advisory. The advisory focuses on Cuba, Mexico, and Jamaica. The advisory states that tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in Western Cuba on Monday. Since Wilmington, DE is not in any of the listed areas, the question cannot be answered.



However, given the provided text, the advisory mentions that tropical storm conditions are expected within 36 hours of the warning being issued. The advisory was issued at 5:00 PM EDT on Sunday. Therefore, tropical storm conditions in the affected areas would be expected to begin around 5:00 PM EDT on Monday.

Therefore, the answer is 36.",60

"A. None



**Explanation:**

The provided text focuses on Hurricane Zeta's impact on the Gulf Coast. Wilmington, DE, is located on the Atlantic coast and is not directly mentioned or predicted to be significantly impacted by this storm. Therefore, the total number of commercial vessels impacted would be none.",A.
A. None,A.
"A. None



**Explanation:**

The provided text focuses on the path and impacts of Tropical Storm Zeta across the Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba, and the Gulf Coast. Wilmington, DE is significantly outside this area and is not mentioned in relation to potential impacts. Therefore, the text suggests no direct impact on Wilmington, DE.",A.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The provided text indicates that Wilmington, DE, is likely to experience heavy rainfall and potential flooding due to Zeta. Commercial vessels are susceptible to disruptions due to such events. Given that the text describes a significant weather event impacting a port city, it's reasonable to anticipate a substantial impact on vessel operations, exceeding the average daily number.",A.
"A. None.

Here's why:

The provided text focuses on the storm's path and potential impacts on land (Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba, US Gulf Coast, etc.). It doesn't mention any specific disruptions to commercial vessel traffic at Wilmington, DE. Wilmington, DE is inland, so it would not be directly impacted by a storm surge or significant wave action. The storm's effects on the Gulf Coast are described, but this doesn's automatically mean a similar impact would be felt in Wilmington, DE.",A.
