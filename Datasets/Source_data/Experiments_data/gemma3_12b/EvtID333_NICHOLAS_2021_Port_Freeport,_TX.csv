"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory highlights ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"" and mentions ""dangerous storm surge"" impacting Port Freeport directly. Given the severity of the predicted conditions (storm surge, high winds, heavy rainfall), it's highly likely that port operations would be suspended, and vessels would be advised to seek shelter. Given the average daily vessel count of 6.33, the total affected commercial vessels is more than 20, to include vessels that were already in the Port.",B.
,B.
"B. 1-10 vessels



**Reasoning:**

The advisory indicates a storm surge of 2-4 feet is expected. While this isn't an extreme surge, it's enough to disrupt port operations. Given that the storm is expected to impact the area from Monday afternoon through Tuesday, a reasonable estimate is that some vessels would be delayed or unable to enter/leave the port. A complete shutdown is unlikely, but some disruption is expected. With an average of 6.33 vessels daily and a period of 24-36 hours of disruption, a few ships (1-10) would likely be affected, and either delayed or rerouted.",B.
