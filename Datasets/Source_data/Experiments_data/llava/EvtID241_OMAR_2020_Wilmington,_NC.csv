"The image does not contain a table or list of coordinates for the current eye of the tropical cyclone. However, it appears to be a track forecast cone from the National Hurricane Center, which typically shows the projected path of a storm over time. This type of chart is often used by meteorologists and emergency management personnel to predict where a storm will make landfall or move over an area. The cone's lines represent probabilities for wind speeds and precipitation at various locations along the forecast track. To obtain current position coordinates, one would need to refer to the most recent data from the National Hurricane Center or another reliable source.","32.6N, 76.5W"

"The image shows a forecast for Tropical Depression Fifteen by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). It indicates that the storm is expected to develop into a tropical storm and will likely stay offshore of North Carolina, posing little to no threat to land. As for freight at Wilmington, NC, there is no indication in the image about when the end of impact would be. However, I can tell you that the last update on the NHC website (as of 16:50 UTC, September 7, 2020) suggests that Tropical Depression Fifteen could become a tropical storm before landfall if it makes landfall at all. It is not possible to determine an exact date for the end of impact on freight at Wilmington based on the image provided.",None
