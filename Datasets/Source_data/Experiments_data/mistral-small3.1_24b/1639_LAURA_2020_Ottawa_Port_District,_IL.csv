Flash flooding and isolated tornadoes.,Minor river rises and localized ponding on terminals; marginal risk of an embedded tornado can’t be ruled out but threat is low this far north
Flooding,Brief river-rise and minor flash-flood risk in low-lying areas; marginal tornado threat south of the port but very low directly at Ottawa
Flooding,"Minor river-level rises possible downstream on the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, but no significant port disruption anticipated"
Tornadoes.,Minor river rises and localized flooding possible along the Illinois River channels near the port.
Tornadoes and Flooding,Potential for localized river flooding along the Illinois River due to upstream heavy rainfall in the Mississippi Valley.
Flooding and Tornadoes.,Brief lightning and localized visibility reductions in heavy rain showers could disrupt barge and lock operations.
Tornadoes.,Brief spin-up tornadoes and localized flash flooding cannot be ruled out as the remnant circulation passes
Tornadoes,Potential navigation restrictions on the Illinois River if upstream rainfall raises river levels
Tornadoes may occur.,Potential for temporary river-current rise and operational delays due to heavy rain and embedded thunderstorms; otherwise minimal tropical-cyclone hazards expected
Riverine flooding and possible inland flooding.,None
