DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rosa was located
near latitude 23.3 North, longitude 118.8 West. Rosa is moving
toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion is expected
to continue through this morning.  A north-northeastward motion is
expected to begin on Monday afternoon and continue through Tuesday.
On the forecast track, the center of Rosa will approach the central
and northern Baja California peninsula on Monday.  Rosa's remnants
will then move quickly across the Desert Southwest on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the next
couple of days, and Rosa is expected to become a tropical storm by
this evening.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Over the next few days, Rosa is expected to produce the
following total rainfall accumulations:

Baja California and northwestern Sonora: 3 to 6 inches, isolated
10 inches.

The Mogollon Rim of Arizona: 2 to 4 inches, isolated 6 inches.

Rest of the Desert Southwest, Central Rockies, and Great Basin:
1 to 2 inches, isolated 4 inches.

These rainfall amounts would produce life-threatening flash flooding
and dangerous debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in
mountainous terrain.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by Monday morning.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible within the watch area by late Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Rosa will affect portions of the coasts
of southwestern Mexico, most of the west coast of the Baja
California peninsula, and southern California from today through
Tuesday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
