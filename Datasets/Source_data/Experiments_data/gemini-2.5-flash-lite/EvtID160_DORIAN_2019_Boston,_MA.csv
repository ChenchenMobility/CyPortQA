"The question asks for the highest 34-kt wind probability for Boston, MA. However, Boston, MA is not listed in the provided ""WIND SPEED PROBABILITY TABLE FOR SELECTED LOCATIONS."" Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the provided data.

Given the constraints, I must select one of the options. Since the data for Boston, MA is missing, I cannot definitively determine the correct answer. However, if this is a multiple-choice question with a guaranteed correct answer from the provided options, and assuming the intent was to test understanding of how to read the table for a *listed* location, I would have to make an educated guess based on the general movement of the storm.

Looking at the locations that are listed, the highest initial probabilities of 34-kt winds are generally in the 0-12 hour (A) and 12-24 hour (B) intervals for locations closer to the storm's initial position.

Without the specific data for Boston, MA, I cannot provide a confident answer. However, if forced to choose, I would need to make an assumption about where Boston might fall relative to the storm's track and the listed locations.

Since I cannot proceed without selecting an answer, and acknowledging the lack of specific data for Boston, MA, I will select an option based on the pattern of highest probabilities in the earlier time intervals for nearby locations.

However, I must reiterate that **the data for Boston, MA is not present in the provided table, making it impossible to answer the question accurately.**

Given that I *must* provide a choice, and that the early time intervals (0-12 and 12-24 hours) show the highest probabilities for many locations, I will select B as a representative answer, but with the strong caveat that Boston is not listed.
