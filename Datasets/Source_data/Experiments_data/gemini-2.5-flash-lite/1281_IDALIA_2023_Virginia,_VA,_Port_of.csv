"The question asks for the highest 34-kt wind probability for ""Virginia, VA, Port of"". However, looking at the provided table, there is no location listed as ""Virginia, VA, Port of"". The closest named location in Virginia is ""OCEANA NAS VA"". Assuming the question intended to ask about ""OCEANA NAS VA"", let's analyze the probabilities for that location:

*   **OCEANA NAS VA 34 KT:**
    *   0-12 hours (18Z TUE to 06Z WED): X (less than 1%)
    *   12-24 hours (06Z WED to 18Z WED): X (less than 1%)
    *   24-48 hours (18Z WED to 06Z THU): X (less than 1%)
    *   48-72 hours (06Z THU to 18Z THU): 2%
    *   72-96 hours (18Z THU to 18Z FRI): 3%
    *   96-120 hours (18Z FRI to 18Z SAT): X (less than 1%)
    *   120+ hours (18Z SAT to 18Z SUN): X (less than 1%)

The highest probability for OCEANA NAS VA is 3% between 72 and 96 hours. This corresponds to the ""48 hours or more"" category.

Let's re-examine the question and the options:
A. 0-12 hours
B. 12-24 Hours
C. 24-48 hours
D. 48 hours or more

For OCEANA NAS VA:
A. 0-12 hours: X%
B. 12-24 Hours: X%
C. 24-48 hours: X%
D. 48 hours or more (specifically 72-96 hours is 3%): 3%

Therefore, the highest probability occurs in the ""48 hours or more"" category.
