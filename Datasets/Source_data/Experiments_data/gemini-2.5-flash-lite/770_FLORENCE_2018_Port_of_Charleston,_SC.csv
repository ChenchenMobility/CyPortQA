"Based on the provided data, Hurricane Florence is forecast to make landfall on the coast of South Carolina by Thursday, September 13th. Given the probability of tropical-storm-force winds reaching Charleston by Friday, September 14th, port operations should consider suspending all ocean-going and commercial vessel activity and implementing preparations for strong winds and heavy rainfall. Vessel traffic should be managed to ensure safe anchorage or departure prior to the arrival of dangerous conditions.","All vessels must initiate heavy-weather preparatory measures, review their storm mooring or departure plans, and maintain readiness to clear the port as conditions escalate."
"* The Port of Charleston, SC, is currently under a Hurricane Warning and has a high probability (over 90%) of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds by Saturday morning.
* Due to the forecast of significant storm surge (4-6 ft) and the potential for hurricane-force winds by Friday, port operations should be suspended, and preparations for hurricane conditions should be completed immediately.","Cargo and facility operations may continue; facility operators should activate hurricane plans, secure loose equipment, and prepare to suspend operations if conditions escalate."
"*   Port operations at Charleston, SC, should prepare for potential tropical-storm-force winds (39+ mph) by Friday, September 14th, with a 66% probability.
*   There is also a 34% chance of hurricane-force winds (74+ mph) reaching Charleston by the same time.","Ports and waterfront facilities remain open for normal operations; operators should secure hazardous cargo, verify emergency equipment, and begin implementing heavy-weather procedures in anticipation of conditions advancing beyond WHISKEY."
"The Port of Charleston, SC has a 33% probability of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds (39 mph) within the next 12 hours, increasing to 75% within 96 hours. With a potential for significant storm surge and hurricane-force winds, operations at the Port of Charleston should be prepared for suspension and eventual closure as conditions deteriorate.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"*   Port of Charleston is projected to experience a high probability (over 70%) of tropical-storm-force winds (39+ mph) within 24 hours.
*   Given these wind probabilities and Florence's forecast to approach the coast on Thursday, it is highly likely that port operations will be suspended or significantly restricted by then to ensure safety.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Port of Charleston, SC is forecast to experience a 33% chance of tropical-storm-force winds within 36 hours, indicating that vessel activity may need to be suspended or significantly limited due to potential for strong winds and rough seas. Operations should be reviewed and preparations made for potential hurricane conditions.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"At the time in_12h (approximately 12 AM AST Monday, September 10, 2018), Port of Charleston, SC has a 13% probability of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds (>= 39 mph). Therefore, general vessel activity may continue with caution, but preparations for potential disruptions should be considered as Florence is forecast to strengthen and approach the coast.","All vessels must initiate heavy-weather preparatory measures, review their storm mooring or departure plans, and maintain readiness to clear the port as conditions escalate."
"*   Based on the forecast, Port of Charleston, SC has a 36% probability of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds (39+ mph) within the next 48 hours.
*   Given this significant probability, operational guidance would likely involve preparations for tropical-storm-force winds, including securing cargo, battening down hatches, and potentially suspending port operations to ensure safety.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"* Based on the Wind Speed Probabilities graphic, the probability of tropical-storm-force winds (39+ mph) reaching Charleston, SC within 12 hours (by 8 AM AST Tuesday, September 11) is less than 5%. Therefore, normal port operations may continue with a watch for increasing conditions.
* However, the track forecast cone indicates Florence will approach the Carolinas on Thursday, and the advisory notes hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by late Thursday. Port authorities should monitor forecasts and prepare for potential disruptions later in the week.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"*   Port of Charleston, SC has a 36% probability of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds by 00Z Tuesday, increasing to 50% by 12Z Tuesday, indicating an imminent need to prepare for potential disruptions.
*   Given Florence's strengthening and expected track towards the Carolinas, vessel operations at Port of Charleston should anticipate a high probability of hurricane-force winds within the next 48-72 hours, necessitating port closure and vessel evacuation by Tuesday morning.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Based on the provided forecast data, by approximately 36 hours from the initial advisory (which would be around 0300Z Tuesday), the Port of Charleston, SC is expected to have a low probability (less than 1%) of experiencing tropical storm-force winds.
