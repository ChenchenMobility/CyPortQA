"The correct answer is B. 0-24 Hours.

Note that the table starts with ""TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM"" and ends with ""$$ FORECASTER BLAKE ..................................."". The data is arranged in a grid format, with each row representing a specific location (e.g., Port of Pascagoula, MS) and column representing a specific forecast time (e.g., 0 hours to 48 hours).

In the first column, under ""34 KT"", you'll find the probability of 34-kt winds at different times. The probabilities are shown as numbers from 0 to 100%.

Looking for the first row where the probability rises above zero, we can see that it's around 1 hour. So, the correct answer is B. 0-24 Hours.",D.
