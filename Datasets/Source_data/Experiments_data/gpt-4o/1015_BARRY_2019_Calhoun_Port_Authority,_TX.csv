"Based on the provided forecast data, we need to locate the relevant data for Calhoun Port Authority, TX. However, the provided data does not include a specific entry for Calhoun Port Authority, TX. Since we need to select from the given choices (A, B, C, or D), and the data does not list this location, we cannot definitively answer the question from the given information.

If we were to assume that Calhoun Port Authority, TX, would follow a similar pattern to nearby locations like Matagorda, TX, or Port O Connor, TX, we would look at those entries:

- **Matagorda, TX**:
  - 0-12 hours: X
  - 12-24 hours: 16
  - 24-48 hours: 7
  - 48 hours or more: 1

- **Port O Connor, TX**:
  - 0-12 hours: X
  - 12-24 hours: 5
  - 24-48 hours: 7
  - 48 hours or more: X

Based on the pattern from nearby locations, the highest 34-kt wind probability for the 24-48 hours interval appears to be consistent. Therefore, if we were to infer:
