"Okay, let's break down this text and answer the question ""When is the expected end date of impact on South Jersey/New Jersey?""

Here's the relevant information from the text and the answer:

*   **The text discusses Subtropical Storm Ana.** It talks about its expected path, potential impacts, and advisory dates.
*   **The most relevant part is the discussion of timing.** The storm is expected to be close to the coasts of South and North Carolina on Sunday.  The final sentence mentions ""next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.""

The question is a bit tricky as it asks about ""impact on South Jersey/New Jersey,"" but the text doesn't give a precise end date for that. However, we can infer.

* **Conclusion**: We don't have a specific date for the ""end of impact"" on South/New Jersey. The text indicates potential impacts by Sunday and the next complete advisory is at 1100 PM EDT on Sunday.  So, the most likely timeframe to be considered would be Sunday.

**Disclaimer**: *This is based on interpreting the available text. The actual impact and duration could be different.*",None

"Based on the provided text, it's impossible to determine the number of impacted commercial vessels at South Jersey Port Corp. The text describes the storm's path, wind probabilities, and potential hazards, but does not mention any specific impact on port operations or vessel numbers.

Therefore, the answer is **A. None**.",A.
"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Location:** The advisory focuses on the Carolinas, with mentions of New Jersey, but doesn's specifically address South Jersey Port Corp.
*   **Impact:** The advisory describes tropical storm conditions (winds, surge, rain). While disruptive, it doesn't explicitly state a complete shutdown of the port.
*   **Average Daily Vessels:** The average is 12.28.
*   **Event Duration:** The storm is expected to impact the Carolinas from Sunday morning, potentially affecting the port over a day or two.

Given that the port is outside of the most severe impact area and the uncertainty of the exact disruption, a moderate impact is most likely. This points to a noticeable but not catastrophic disruption.

**Therefore, the answer is C. 10-20 vessels**",A.
B. 1-10 vessels,A.
C. 10-20 vessels,A.
"Given the information provided, we need to infer the impact on the South Jersey Port Corp. Here's the reasoning:

*   **Storm Location:** Subtropical Storm Ana is forecast to impact the Southeast U.S. coast, specifically from South Carolina to North Carolina.
*   **Port Location:** The South Jersey Port Corp. is in New Jersey, which is further north and less directly in the path of the storm.
*   **Storm Impact:** While the storm may cause some disruption, it's unlikely to cause a complete shutdown or significant delays that would impact a large number of vessels.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer is:

**A. None**



**Important Note:** This is an educated guess based on the provided information. A more accurate assessment would require detailed weather models, port operational plans, and real-time updates during the event.",A.
