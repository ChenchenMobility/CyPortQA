DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM EST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eta was 
located near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 84.9 West. The 
depression is moving toward the east-northeast near 10 mph (17 
km/h). An east-northeast to northeast motion at a faster forward 
speed is expected through early Sunday. A turn toward the north and 
northwest are expected by Sunday afternoon. On the forecast track, 
the center of Eta will approach the Cayman Islands later today, be 
near central Cuba tonight and Sunday, and near the Florida Keys or 
south Florida Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Eta is forecast to become a tropical storm again later today,
with further strengthening likely through Sunday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Eta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC, and on the
web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Eta is expected to produce the following rainfall amounts
through Thursday morning:
 
Portions of Central America: An additional 2 to 5 inches (50 to 125
mm), isolated maximum storm totals of 40 inches (1000 mm) in eastern
Honduras and eastern Nicaragua.
 
Jamaica: An additional 2 to 4 inches (50 to 125 mm), isolated
maximum storm totals of 15 inches (380 mm).
 
The Cayman Islands into portions of Cuba: an additional 5 to 10
inches (125 to 255 mm), isolated storm totals of 25 inches (650 mm).
 
The Bahamas and portions of the Florida peninsula, including the
Keys: 5 to 10 inches (125 to 255 mm), isolated maximum totals of 15
inches (380 mm).
 
The threat of life-threatening flooding will continue across
portions of Central America, along with landslides in areas of
higher terrain. Significant, life-threatening flash and river
flooding will be possible in Cuba, along with landslides in areas of
higher terrain. Flash and urban flooding will also be possible for
the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Southern Florida.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by as
much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of Cuba
near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.  Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Marco Island, FL to North Miami Beach, FL including Biscayne
Bay...2-3 ft
Florida Keys...2-3 ft
North Miami Beach, FL to Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands
this afternoon and evening, in the warning area in Cuba tonight
and Sunday, and in the northwestern Bahamas on Sunday.  Tropical 
storm conditions are possible in the watch area in Cuba tonight and 
Sunday and in the watch area in south Florida and the Florida Keys 
by late Sunday.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur Sunday evening and Sunday
night over south Florida and the Keys.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Eta are expected to spread northeastward
and affect the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, the southern coast of
Cuba, the northwestern Bahamas, and southern Florida and the
Florida Keys during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
