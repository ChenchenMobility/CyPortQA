"I'm happy to help! However, I need to clarify that the given text is not a forecast or weather report, but rather a template for a forecast. The text contains placeholders and does not provide specific information about wind probabilities.

"The forecast is in a format that's not easily parseable by me. However, I can try to help you find the answer.

It looks like the text is a weather forecast, and it's written in a format that's commonly used for marine forecasts. The format includes various pieces of information, such as wind probabilities, wave heights, and storm tracks.

To find the answer, you'll need to search through the text and look for the section that pertains to the Port of Palm Beach District, FL. You'll want to find the line that says something like ""34-kt wind probability"" or ""peak winds.""

Once you've found that line, you can try to determine when the 34-kt wind probability peaks. This might involve looking at the time stamp associated with that line, or searching for other lines in the forecast that provide more information about the timing of the peak winds.
