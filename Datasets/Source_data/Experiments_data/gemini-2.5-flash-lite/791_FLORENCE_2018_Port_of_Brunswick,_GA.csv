"The question asks for the highest 34-kt wind probability for Port of Brunswick, GA. However, Port of Brunswick, GA is not explicitly listed in the provided table. I will look for the closest listed location, which is GEORGETOWN SC, as it is the nearest significant port south of the listed locations.

Let's analyze the 34-kt wind probabilities for GEORGETOWN SC:
- 0-12 hours (FROM 00Z FRI TO 12Z FRI): 45%
- 12-24 hours (FROM 12Z FRI TO 00Z SAT): 44%
- 24-48 hours (FROM 00Z SAT TO 12Z SAT): 5%
- 48 hours or more (FROM 12Z SAT TO 00Z WED): 1%

Comparing these values:
A. 0-12 hours: 45%
B. 12-24 Hours: 44%
C. 24-48 hours: 5%
D. 48 hours or more: 1%

The highest probability is 45% in the 0-12 hour time interval.
