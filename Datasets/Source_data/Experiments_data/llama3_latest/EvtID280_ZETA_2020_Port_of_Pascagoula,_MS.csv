"Based on the provided data, I would choose:

C. 24-48 hours

This is because the highest probability of 34-kt winds (21/100 = 21%) is forecasted within the 24-48 hour time interval for the Port of Pascagoula, MS.",B.
"According to the text, there is no specific information about Port of Pascagoula, MS. However, we can analyze the table and find that the highest 34-kt wind probability for a nearby location (Keesler AB) is in the 0-12 hour interval with a value of 57%. Therefore, I will make an educated guess based on this information.

A. 0-12 hours",C.
"Based on the information provided, the highest 34-kt wind probability for Port of Pascagoula, MS is indicated in option C: 24-48 hours.

Here's why:

* The forecasted time interval with the highest 34-kt wind probability is mentioned as ""23(23)"" under the heading ""PENSACOLA NAS"" (which includes Port of Pascagoula, MS).
* This corresponds to the 24-48 hour time frame, as indicated in option C.

"According to the forecast data, the highest 34-kt wind probability for Port of Pascagoula, MS is indicated in option C: 24-48 hours.

The relevant line from the forecast data reads:

""PASCAGOULA MS 34 X X X X X 2(2) 4(6)""

This indicates a 2% chance of 34-kt winds within the next 2 hours (0-2 hours), and a 4% chance within the next 24 hours (12-36 hours). The probability increases to 6% within the next 48 hours.",D.
