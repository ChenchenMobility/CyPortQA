Flooding in low-lying areas,Brief tornadoes in outer rain-bands; restricted visibility and rough seas affecting vessel traffic in Sabineâ€“Neches Waterway
"Port Arthur, TX is in close proximity to Tropical Storm Barry's predicted path, which may lead to additional hazards such as potential flooding from heavy rains, debris from damaged structures, and increased risk of accidents due to slippery surfaces.",Brief tornadoes in outer rain-bands cannot be ruled out
"The image does not show any additional hazards besides rainfall, wind, and storm surge.",Isolated tornadoes possible in outer rain bands; brief visibility reductions and lightning could disrupt terminal/berth operations
"In addition to heavy rain and storm surges, there is a risk of tornadoes in Port Arthur, TX.",Brief tornadoes in spiral bands cannot be ruled out.
"The image depicts a track forecast cone and a cyclonic public advisory from National Hurricane Center for a potential tropical cyclone. It shows the projected path of the storm with the probability of its center passing through the cone. There is also information about the current position of the system, its maximum sustained winds, and its central pressure. The image indicates that there are watches in effect for storm surge, hurricane, and tropical storm conditions across different areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast from the Upper Texas Coast to the Florida Panhandle. It emphasizes the need to monitor products issued by local National Weather Service forecast offices for storm information specific to one's area. The image notes that the storm is expected to approach the Louisiana coast this weekend and may become a tropical depression, tropical storm, and hurricane by late Thursday or Friday. The text highlights that formation chances through 48 hours and 5 days are high. It includes key messages for the system, such as the potential for life-threatening inundation from rising waters moving inland from the coastline in the indicated areas during the next 48 hours. The image states that the storm surge and tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline, with the water reaching up to 3 to 6 feet above ground somewhere in the affected area if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide. It mentions that rainfall amounts exceeding 6 to 9 inches have already occurred across portions of the New Orleans metropolitan area today, which has resulted in flooding. The image also provides information about the estimated minimum central pressure and the need to monitor for updates on this system.","Port operations may be affected by restricted visibility in squalls, possible river/stream flooding, and temporary closure of the Sabine-Neches ship channel."
"Additional hazards associated with the possible future storm at Port Arthur, TX include flooding, damage to infrastructure, and potential disruptions to transportation and commerce.","Brief tornado threat in outer rainbands; reduced visibility, heavy squalls, and short-notice berth closures likely."
