"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory mentions potential hazards (wind, storm surge, rainfall) that would significantly disrupt port operations. Given the potential for disruption and the scale of the storm, it's highly probable that the port would experience a substantial impact, leading to a significant number of vessels being affected.",A.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory mentions potential hazards (surf, rip currents, rainfall) affecting the southeastern U.S. coast, including South Carolina. Given the predicted rainfall accumulations of 1 to 3 inches, with isolated amounts of 5 inches, over eastern portions of North Carolina and South Carolina, it is reasonable to assume that some disruption to port operations is likely. Given that the typical number of vessels is 11 and the potential for significant disruption due to weather, it's likely that a substantial number of vessels would be affected, exceeding 20.",A.
