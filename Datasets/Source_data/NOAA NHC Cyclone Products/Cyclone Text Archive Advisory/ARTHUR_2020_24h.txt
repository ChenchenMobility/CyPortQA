DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Arthur was
located near latitude 30.5 North, longitude 77.4 West. Arthur is
moving toward the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn
toward the northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected
during the next 24 to 48 hours.  On the forecast track, Arthur will
remain well offshore the east coast of Florida, Georgia, and 
South Carolina today, and then move near or just east of the coast 
of North Carolina on Monday.  Arthur is forecast to turn away from 
the U.S. East Coast on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast 
during the next 24 to 36 hours.  Arthur is likely to lose tropical 
characteristics on Tuesday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force 
reconnaissance aircraft is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the Tropical
Storm Warning area on Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Arthur is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
1 to 3 inches over coastal North Carolina tonight and Monday,
with locally higher amounts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Arthur are affecting portions of
the southeast U.S. coast and are expected to spread northward along
the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast during the next day or two.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions
across much of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
