"The image you've provided shows a map from the National Hurricane Center indicating a tropical cyclone with its forecast track cone. However, I am not able to see the specific eye of the tropical cyclone in this image. Tropical cyclones, also known as hurricanes or typhoons, do not have a single, well-defined ""eye"" like a traditional storm system. Instead, they are characterized by a closed circulation, with wind patterns that can shift over time due to various atmospheric processes.

In the context of tropical cyclones, the term ""eye"" is often used metaphorically to describe the central part of the storm where the most intense winds and precipitation occur. This is where the eye wall forms, which consists of the innermost and most dangerous part of a hurricane or typhoon. The image you've provided seems to be showing a forecast track cone for a tropical cyclone, but the specific location or coordinates of the ""eye"" are not visible in this particular image.

To find the current eye of the tropical cyclone, one would need to check the latest official reports from the National Hurricane Center or another authoritative meteorological agency that provides the most up-to-date information on tropical cyclones. The best source for tracking and forecasting tropical cyclones is usually the National Hurricane Center's website (nhc.noaa.gov).","18.4N, 87.1W"
