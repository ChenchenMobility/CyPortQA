"The image depicts a tropical storm advisory for Eta issued by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on November 10, 2020. The storm is moving northward over western Cuba, and it's expected to produce heavy rainfall in Cuba and South Florida. The NHC predicts that tropical storm conditions may be possible in the Tropical Storm Watch area for Cuba today.

The advisory states that Eta is forecast to produce an additional 3 to 5 inches (75 to 125 mm) of rainfall in western Cuba, with isolated maximum storm total accumulations of 25 inches (765 mm). In South Florida, an additional 1 to 2 inches (25 to 50 mm) is expected, with isolated maximum storm total accumulations of 20 inches (510 mm). The advisory also warns of potential flash and river flooding in western Cuba and landslides in areas of higher terrain. It also mentions life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the north coast of Cuba, the northwestern Bahamas, southern Florida, and the Florida Keys during the next day or so.

The NHC does not provide an exact date for when the expected start of impact on freight at Port Everglades, FL will occur, as it depends on the storm's track and intensity.

It is expected to continue moving toward the west-northwest at 13 mph (20 km/h). The advisory states that the storm surge warning and storm surge watch have been discontinued, while a hurricane warning for the Florida Keys and Florida Bay has been replaced with a tropical storm warning. A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Cuba, and a Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, generally within 36 hours.
