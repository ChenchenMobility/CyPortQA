"The provided data does not include information for South Jersey Port Corp, NJ. Therefore, based on the available data, the answer cannot be determined. However, if we were to infer from the given data structure, we would expect the format to follow a similar pattern to follow a similar pattern. Since the question asks for the first time the probability rises above zero, we can deduce the following:

Given the structure of the data, the probabilities are listed in increments (0 hours, 0-24 hours, 24-48 hours, etc.). If the probability of 34-kt winds is listed as ""X"" for 0 hours, it means it is zero at that time. The next increment where it is not ""X"" would be the first time the probability rises above zero.

Since the question specifically asks for the first time the probability rises above zero, and assuming the data for South Jersey Port Corp, NJ would follow a similar pattern, the answer would likely be:

B. 0-24 Hours",B.
D. 48 hours or more,B.

"The data provided does not include information for South Jersey Port Corp, NJ. Therefore, based on the given data, it is not possible to determine when the probability of 34-kt winds rises above zero for South Jersey Port Corp, NJ.

However, since the question requires a choice (A, B, C, or D), and assuming the structure of the data would be similar if it were included, we can infer that the probability would likely follow a pattern similar to other locations. Given that most locations start seeing non-zero probabilities within the first 48 hours, the most reasonable guess would be:

C. 24-48 hours",D.
D,D.

Rip currents,Dangerous rip currents along the New Jersey shore through the weekend due to large swells from Florence
Coastal flooding is a potential additional hazard.,Inland river rises on the Delaware and tidal back-up could briefly slow drainage; rough Atlantic surf and dangerous rip-currents through the weekend.
Possible Rip Currents,High surf and dangerous rip currents along the New Jersey coast through the weekend
Flooding,Dangerous surf and rip currents along the New Jersey shore beginning late week
Rip currents,Dangerous rip currents and rough surf; possible river flooding from upstream rainfall could disrupt ground transport to the port
Flooding from heavy rainfall upstream could exacerbate inland river flooding.,Large swells and dangerous rip currents; possible upstream river flooding that could disrupt barge traffic and terminal access.
Rip currents and rough surf are expected.,High surf and dangerous rip currents along the New Jersey shore likely beginning mid-week and persisting through the weekend
Rip Currents,Fresh-water river flooding and possible brief tornadoes in spiral rain bands could disrupt terminal and rail operations.
"Rip currents, Swells",High surf and dangerous rip currents along the New Jersey shore beginning mid-week.
Rip currents and dangerous surf.,Long-period swells will produce dangerous surf and rip currents along the New Jersey coast well before any wind or rain arrives.
