"The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a public advisory from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) about a potential tropical cyclone in the southeastern United States. However, I am unable to directly interact with images and only text-based information can be used.

Based on the information provided in the text within the image, it is not possible for me to accurately determine the exact time when Wilmington, NC will begin experiencing tropical storm conditions without specific details about the system's movement and intensification. The advisory notes that tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the warning area in North Carolina on Friday, but does not provide a more precise timeline for any individual location like Wilmington.

For up-to-date information and specific timelines, it is recommended to consult official weather forecasts from the National Weather Service (NWS) or other reputable sources.",45
