To get the current eye position, you would need to refer to the most recent official advisory or bulletin provided by the National Hurricane Center, which typically includes the latest forecast track and position of the cyclone's center, along with its associated wind speed, storm surge potential, etc.","21.9N, 92.6W"

If you're looking for the current position of a tropical cyclone, I would need to reference a more up-to-date source, like the National Hurricane Center's official advisories or public reports, which typically provide the most accurate and up-to-date information on the current location and track of storms.","21.5N, 92.5W"

Floodwaters can cause transportation disruptions including road closures and damage to infrastructure.,"Large destructive waves, dangerous surf and rip currents; prolonged flooding because the cyclone is expected to stall near the coast."
"The image shows a map from NOAA of Tropical Depression Harvey's track forecast cone, indicating that there is a possibility of storm conditions approaching the Texas coast later Friday or Friday night.",Dangerous surf and rip currents; prolonged flooding risk due to very slow storm motion that could keep port operations disrupted for several days.
"The track forecast cone from National Hurricane Center shows that the cyclone is expected to pass over the Gulf of Mexico, so there could be potential hazards associated with the possible future storm at Corpus Christi, TX, such as rough seas and offshore oil rig operations in the area being affected by this tropical depression.",Dangerous surf and rip currents beginning Thursday night; potential prolonged flooding if the system stalls inland.
