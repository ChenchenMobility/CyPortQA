"The image you've provided shows a map from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) tracking the movement of Tropical Depression Fifteen. Based on the information available on this track, it is difficult to accurately predict the exact timing and peak impact on freight at Port of Palm Beach District, FL. The hurricane may affect different regions or timeframes depending on its path and development over time. To get an accurate prediction, one would need to monitor the most recent advisories from the NHC and local authorities who are better equipped to provide forecasts for specific locations.",None
"The image shows a weather map with various overlays and data points. The track forecast cone for Tropical Depression Fifteen is shown, indicating the potential path and intensity of the storm. There is also information about wind probabilities and warnings for specific locations on Tuesday, August 4th, at 6:00 PM EDT. The wind speeds are depicted as a probability curve for various locations, with probabilities ranging from 1% to 100%.

The map includes a forecast of track speed probabilities over the next five days and a note indicating that the storm center does not show up in the current image. The National Hurricane Center's advisory is also present, providing a summary of the system's conditions. There are warnings about surf conditions along the coast of North Carolina.

The map does not provide specific information on when or how Tropical Depression Fifteen will impact freight at Port of Palm Beach District, FL. The focus of the image is on the storm track and potential wind speeds rather than on the impact on freight.",None
