"Given that San Juan, PR is not listed in the data, the answer cannot be determined. However, I can answer the question if I assume that ""San Juan, PR"" refers to the ""SANTO DOMINGO"" listed.

*   **34 kt winds:**
    *   Hour 34: 1
    *   Hour 0-24: No data for Santo Domingo.
    *   Hour 24-48: No data for Santo Domingo.
    *   Hour 48 or more: No data for Santo Domingo.

"Given the information provided in the lengthy bulletin, it's impossible to determine the total number of commercial vessels impacted at San Juan, PR. The bulletin focuses on Matthew's path, rainfall, surge, and general impact on the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. There is no mention of San Juan or its commercial port.

Therefore, the best answer is **A. None**.",B.

A. None,B.
"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Event Duration:** The advisory indicates Matthew will impact the region over multiple days (affecting Haiti tonight, Cuba Tuesday, Bahamas late Tuesday/Wednesday). Let's assume a minimum of 3 days based on this.
*   **San Juan's Location:** San Juan is on the island of Puerto Rico. While Puerto Rico is not directly listed as being under a warning or watch, it will be impacted by the storm's effects.
*   **Vessel Impact:** The advisory mentions large swells and potential hazards affecting the coasts of the region.
*   **Calculation:** Average daily vessels (11.75083663) x number of days impacted (3) = 35.25. Rounding up, this is closest to 35-40.

**Therefore, the answer is D. 20 vessels or more**",B.
