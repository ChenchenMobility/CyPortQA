"The image provided appears to be a forecast from the National Weather Service (NWS), specifically for the Great Lakes region. It shows the probabilities of different wind speeds (34, 50, 64 knots) at various locations in the area over the next five days.

The NWS uses a color scale to represent the probability of each wind speed: green represents less than 10% chance, yellow indicates a 10-30% probability, and red signifies a higher probability of that wind speed occurring.

To determine how many hours remain until the 50-kt (about 58 mph) wind probability peaks at Detroit-Wayne County Port, MI within the next 5 days, we would need to examine the forecast graphics and interpret the color scale's meaning in terms of time. The image does not provide a clear numerical value or time reference that allows us to determine the exact number of hours remaining.

To obtain this information, you would have to refer to the NWS website, where the most up-to-date forecast and corresponding graphics are available. Alternatively, you can access local weather radar and forecasts through various online sources.",96
