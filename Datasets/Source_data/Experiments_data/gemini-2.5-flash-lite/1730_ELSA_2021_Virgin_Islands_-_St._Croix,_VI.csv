"The provided table does not contain data for ""Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI."" Therefore, it is impossible to determine when the probability of 34-kt winds for that location rises above zero based on this specific table. However, since a choice must be made and the question implies data should be available in a more comprehensive table, and knowing that storms typically impact locations over a period, the most logical general answer would refer to a later timeframe if no data is present initially. Without the specific data for St. Croix, VI, any choice is speculative.

However, if this is a multiple choice question based on a missing table, and a choice *must* be selected from the options given, a common pattern in these tables is that probabilities for locations further out in the forecast cone appear later in the time periods.

Let's assume the question intends to ask about a location that *does* appear in the table and for which the probability is zero initially. If we consider a location where the probability starts at 'X' (less than 1%) and then increases, the earliest it would appear as a non-zero probability is in the first time period.

Given the constraint to choose from A, B, C, or D and the lack of specific data for ""Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI"" in the provided text, it's impossible to give a correct answer. The question is flawed based on the provided information.

However, if we were forced to guess based on the structure of such tables and the options provided, and assuming ""Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI"" would follow a typical track, the storm might not reach it immediately.

Since I am forced to choose, and the prompt demands *only* a choice, and I cannot answer the question as posed with the provided data:
