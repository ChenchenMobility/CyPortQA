"D. 20 vessels or more.

**Explanation:**

The text highlights the severe threat of storm surge and hurricane conditions impacting the Florida Keys and surrounding areas, including PortMiami. The predicted rainfall totals (10-20 inches, isolated 25) and potential for life-threatening flash floods suggest a significant disruption to port operations. Given the potential for such widespread disruption and the scale of the storm, it’s highly likely that a substantial number of vessels would be impacted, exceeding 20.",A.
,A.
,A.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The forecast for PortMiami includes ""Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in Florida by Sunday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late Saturday."" This indicates a significant disruption to operations. Given the scale of Irma and the number of vessels typically present, a closure impacting more than 20 vessels is highly probable.",A.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The provided text indicates that Irma is expected to impact southeastern Florida and the upper Florida Keys. PortMiami is located in southeastern Florida. The advisory mentions ""hurricane conditions are expected... late Saturday."" Given the average daily vessel count and the anticipated severity and duration of the hurricane's impact, it's highly probable that a significant number of vessels would be affected and/or delayed, leading to a total impact of 20 or more.",A.
D. 20 vessels or more,A.
A. None,A.
,A.
A. None,A.
"A. None

Here's why:

*   **Irma's Path & Impact:** The advisory details Irma's trajectory and predicted impact primarily focuses on the Leeward Islands, British Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. While PortMiami is in Florida, the direct threat described is not centered on that location.
*   **Indirect Impact:** While PortMiami might experience some indirect effects (e.g., disruptions to supply chains), the primary danger outlined is not directly affecting that port. A ""none"" scenario is the most plausible given the focus of the provided information.",A.
