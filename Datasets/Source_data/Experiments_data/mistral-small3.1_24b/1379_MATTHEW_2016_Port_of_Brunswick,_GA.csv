"To determine the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at the Port of Brunswick, GA within the next 5 days, we need to locate the relevant data in the provided forecast.

Unfortunately, the Port of Brunswick, GA is not explicitly listed in the data provided. However, we can infer the probability by looking at nearby locations and their probabilities. The closest relevant locations in the data are Savannah GA and Kings Bay GA.

For Savannah GA:
- Day 1: 73
- Day 2: 6 (cumulative 79)
- Day 3: X (cumulative 79)
- Day 4: X (cumulative 79)
- Day 5: X (cumulative 79)

For Kings Bay GA:
- Day 1: 83
- Day 2: X (cumulative 83)
- Day 3: X (cumulative 83)
- Day 4: X (cumulative 83)
- Day 5: Day 5: X (cumulative 83)

Given that Kings Bay GA has a higher probability (83 probability, we can use this as an upper bound estimate for the Port of Brunswick, GA.

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at the Port of Brunswick, GA within the next 5 days is approximately 83.",83%
