**Explanation:**

The provided text doesn't directly state the number of vessels impacted at Canaveral Port District. However, it discusses potential impacts from Ian, including:

*   **Storm Surge:** This could disrupt port operations and affect vessels.
*   **High Rainfall:** Can cause flooding and disruptions.
*   **Tornadoes:** Pose a risk to vessels and infrastructure.
*   **Surf and Rip Currents:** Can make navigation hazardous.
*   **Overall Disruption:** The text suggests a significant level of potential disruption to the region.

Given the comprehensive disruption potential indicated, it's reasonable to assume that a significant number of vessels would be affected, even if some are able to leave the port before the worst of the storm. The mention of significant disruption suggests impacts beyond the typical daily average.",C.
