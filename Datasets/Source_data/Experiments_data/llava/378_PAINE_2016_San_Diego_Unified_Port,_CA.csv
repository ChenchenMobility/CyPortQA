"The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a National Hurricane Center (NHC) advisory for Tropical Storm Paine.

However, the NHC advisory includes information about the storm's path and intensity, but it does not specify the exact timeline for impacts like those you mentioned.

If you are seeking information related to how a tropical storm can impact freight at a port, such as San Diego Unified Port, here is some general information:

Tropical storms, including hurricanes and typhoons, can have several direct and indirect effects on port operations:

1. Disruptions to cargo flow: Tropical storms can cause delays in the arrival and departure of ships due to the need for safe navigation conditions. This may result in missed schedules or cargo being held up until it is safe for vessels to operate in the affected area.

2. Port closures: In severe cases, a tropical storm can lead to temporary closure of ports, as well as restrictions on port activity such as docking and unloading. This could impact freight movement, leading to potential delays or diversions of cargo.

3. Impact on infrastructure: Tropical storms can cause damage to port facilities, including piers, loading and unloading equipment, warehouses, and the supporting transportation network (e.g., roads, bridges, railways). This can lead to repair work that may disrupt regular operations at the port.

4. Potential for cargo damage: Tropical storms can cause water damage or other cargo-related issues if ships are caught in the path of the storm and must ride out the conditions.

5. Disruptions to transportation networks: The roads, bridges, railways, and other transportation infrastructure may be impacted by flooding, landslides, wind damage, or other effects of the tropical storm. This can lead to delays in cargo transport over land, potentially affecting the supply chain's ability to deliver goods to the port and from it.

6. Environmental hazards: Tropical storms can bring saltwater intrusion into fresh water supplies, which can impact the availability of water for port operations or nearby communities.

7. Economic impacts on the local economy: The indirect effects of a tropical storm, such as business closures and reduced consumer spending, could impact freight demand in the short term.

8. Increased costs: Ports may need to spend additional funds on storm recovery efforts, repairs, or contingency plans to ensure operations can continue safely after the storm passes.

It is important to note that the actual impacts of a tropical storm depend on its strength, duration, and the specific location and infrastructure of the port affected by the storm.",None
