"As a cyclone and port operations analyst, I can analyze the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center.

From the image provided, I see that the areas under Tropical Storm (TS) Watch are:

Hattiesburg MS to Destin FL
None

And the areas under Hurricane Watch are:

Destin FL to Englewood FL",Central Bahamas
Tampa Bay to Pensacola Florida,None at this time; interests in South Florida and the Florida Keys are advised to monitor the system
"Jacksonville Beach, FL to Flagler Beach, FL",Isla de la Juventud to Villa Clara Cuba and the north-western Bahamas
"[img-0]: **South Carolina to North Carolina**

Please note: Based on the provided Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, the specified area is within the Tropical Storm Warning zone.","Tropical Storm Warning for Isla de la Juventud and western Cuba provinces, and for the north-western Bahamas"

"According to the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, I can see that the cyclone is currently located at (lat: 25.0, lon: -76.0) and is expected to make landfall at (lat: 30.0, lon: -80.0).

Using the distance formula, I calculate the distance between the current position and the projected landfall to be approximately:

√((30.0-25.0)^2 + (-80.0-(-76.0))^2) ≈ 345 km

Assuming an average forward speed of 20 km/h for hurricanes, I estimate that around 17 hours will pass before the cyclone reaches its projected landfall.

So, my answer is: **17**",10
"Based on the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, I can analyze the data.

Please provide me with the coordinates of the cyclone's current position and the predicted landfall location. Once I have that information, I'll give you the answer in hours. If no landfall is expected, I'll output 'None'.",24

Isolated tornadoes are possible across far South Florida and the Florida Keys from midday through this evening.,Brief tornadoes possible Saturday afternoon and evening across South Florida
The possibility of rough seas and high waves along the Miami coast may pose a hazard for boats and vessels operating in the port area.,"Frequent squalls reducing visibility, lightning, and short-period harbor swell that could disrupt cargo handling and pilot transfers"
