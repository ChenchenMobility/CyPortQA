Note: The gale force probability is evaluated based on the maximum sustained wind speeds and the forecast track. In this case, gale force winds are defined as winds of 34kt or greater. The probability of reaching these wind speeds at each time interval is assigned a label (OFF, LOW, MODERATE, HIGH, VERY HIGH, EXTREMELY HIGH) based on the likelihood and confidence in the forecast.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '1%', 'in 96h': '14%'}"
"Based on the information provided in the bulletin, it appears that the expected start of impact on freight at Port of Pascagoula, MS is not explicitly mentioned. However, since the depression is forecast to emerge into the northwestern Caribbean Sea on Friday and move across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras late Thursday, we can infer that the effects of the storm may begin to impact freight in the region around those dates. Therefore, the expected start of impact on freight at Port of Pascagoula could be around 24-10-2017 or 25-10-2017 (24th and 25th of October, 2017). However, this is an estimate based on the available information, and actual impact dates may vary.",10/6/2017

"I do not have access to specific forecasts for individual ports. However, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) advisory on October 4, 2017 at 8:00 PM EDT, Tropical Depression Sixteen was expected to emerge into the northwestern Caribbean Sea by Friday, and become a tropical storm overnight. The NHC advises that interests in Honduras, the Bay Islands, western Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula should monitor the progress of the depression. A hurricane watch could be issued for portions of the Yucatan Peninsula this evening. Please check the latest advisories from the NHC for updated information on the predicted peak impact on freight at Port of Pascagoula, MS.",10/7/2017
