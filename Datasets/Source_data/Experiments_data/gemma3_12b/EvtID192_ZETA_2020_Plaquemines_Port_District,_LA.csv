A. None,D.
D. 20 vessels or more,D.
"A. None



**Reasoning:**

The advisory explicitly mentions that the heaviest rainfall and potential impacts will be focused on areas further east, such as southeastern Mississippi, southern Alabama, northern Georgia, and the Tennessee Valley. While Plaquemines Port District is in Louisiana, the advisory doesn's highlight it as a primary area of concern. The focus on rainfall and potential tornadoes further east suggests a lower likelihood of significant disruption to vessel traffic at Plaquemines Port District.",D.
B. 1-10 vessels,D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

Here's why the answer is D, based on the provided information:

*   **Zeta's projected path:** The advisory indicates that Zeta will approach the northern Gulf Coast on Wednesday. Plaquemines Port District is located on the Gulf Coast.
*   **Rainfall and Wind Hazards:** The forecast includes significant rainfall and wind hazards along the Gulf Coast. This would likely disrupt vessel operations, leading to delays or diversions.
*   **Average Vessel Count:** While the average daily vessel count is 58.42409492, a significant weather event like Zeta would almost certainly impact far more than a few vessels.
* **Impact from storm surge**: Storm surge from the weather event is predicted, and will likely disrupt port operations.",D.
