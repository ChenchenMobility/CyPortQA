"The table provided shows the probability of winds in excess of 34 kts (beaufort force 12) occurring over different areas over the next five days. This information can be used to determine when the wind probability will peak at a specific location, such as Jacksonville, FL.

To determine how many hours remain until the 34-kt wind probability peaks at Jacksonville, we need to look for the maximum probability of winds greater than 34 kts in the next five days and then count the number of hours remaining until that time.

In the table provided, the highest probability of winds greater than 34 kts is 85% (or a 0.85 probability) at Jacksonville within the next five days. This means there is an 85% chance of winds greater than 34 kts occurring at Jacksonville during that period.

To find out how many hours remain until this probability peaks, we need to look for when the probability reaches its peak in the next five days. From the table, we can see that the probability starts at 0% and increases over time. The probability reaches its peak at around 348 hours (or just under 14 days) from now.

Therefore, if we subtract the current time from 348 hours, we can find out how many hours remain until the wind probability peaks at Jacksonville, FL within the next 5 days.

Without knowing the current time, I am unable to provide a specific number of hours remaining. However, based on the information provided in the table, it is clear that the wind probability will peak at Jacksonville within approximately 348 hours (or just under 14 days) from now.",120

"The provided text is a list of locations and their corresponding probabilities for 50-knot winds at each location over the next five days. To determine how many hours remain until the 50-kt wind probability peaks at Jacksonville, FL within the next 5 days, we need to look for the hourly forecasts that include Jacksonville, FL and then identify the hour in which the 50-knot wind probability is highest.

Looking through the provided text, it appears that the maximum 50-kt wind probability at Jacksonville, FL is 2% and occurs at 18 hours from now. Since we are looking at the forecasts over the next five days, this suggests that there are 96 hours remaining until the peak wind probability at Jacksonville, FL (5 days \* 24 hours/day + 18 hours = 96 hours).",120
