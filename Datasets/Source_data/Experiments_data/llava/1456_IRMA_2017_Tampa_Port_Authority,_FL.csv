Explanation:
The gale force probability (34kt) is the probability of winds reaching or exceeding 34 knots (about 40 mph or 65 km/h). In this case, it seems that there is no likelihood of reaching 34 knots in the next 12 hours. However, there is a 1% chance (low) of reaching gale force winds within 48 hours, and a 2% chance (medium-low) within 72 hours, with a 3% chance (medium) within 96 hours. These probabilities are based on the information provided in the advisory and do not take into account any potential changes in wind speeds or other factors that could affect the storm's intensity.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '20%'}"
