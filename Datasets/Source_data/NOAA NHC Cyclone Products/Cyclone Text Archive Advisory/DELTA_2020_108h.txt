DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Delta was 
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 78.4 West. The 
storm is moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and 
this general motion should continue for the next day or so.  A 
faster northwestward motion is expected on Tuesday and Wednesday.  
On the forecast track, the center of Delta is expected to 
move away from Jamaica later today, move near or over the Cayman 
Islands later tonight, and approach the Isle of Youth and western 
Cuba Tuesday afternoon or evening. Delta is forecast to move into 
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico Tuesday night or early Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is expected during the 
next few days, and the tropical storm is expected to be a hurricane 
when it moves near or over western Cuba.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) 
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
