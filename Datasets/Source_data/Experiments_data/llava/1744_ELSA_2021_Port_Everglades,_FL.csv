"The image shows a map of the United States with a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean. The map highlights potential impacts on port operations, indicating that ports along the southeastern coast of the United States, particularly those in Florida and the Gulf Coast region, may be affected by the storm.","Florida west coast and Big Bend, coastal Georgia, South Carolina Low-country, then Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts later in the period"
"The image displays a map showing a track forecast cone for a tropical cyclone named Elsa. According to the map, the coastal region that is most likely to be affected by this storm is in the southeastern United States, particularly along the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida. Specifically, the areas of concern include Corpus Christi, Houston, Galveston Bay, and the Florida Panhandle.","Florida Keys, entire west coast of Florida, Florida Big Bend, then Atlantic coasts of GA/SC/NC into New England"
"The image depicts a map of the United States showing the forecast track of a tropical cyclone overlaid on a map of the continental United States. The map is color-coded to indicate the probability of storm center passes, with different colors representing low, moderate, and high probabilities.

Based on this image, it appears that ports located along the eastern coastline from Florida to Georgia are most likely to be affected by the tropical cyclone. Specifically, the areas where a port might experience impacts from the storm are those coastal regions directly in the path of the storm or within the forecast cone. The specific ports could include:

1. Ports along the coast of Florida (e.g., Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach)
2. Ports on the eastern seaboard of Georgia and the Carolinas (e.g., Savannah, Charleston, Wilmington)
3. The northern coastline of the Carolinas (e.g., Morehead City, Beaufort)
4. The coastal regions of Virginia and Maryland (e.g., Norfolk, Chesapeake Bay ports like Baltimore or Annapolis)
5. The eastern shore of Delaware and Maryland (e.g., Dover, Baltimore)
6. Coastal areas of New Jersey and New York (e.g., Port Elizabeth, Port Newark, New York Harbor)

It is important to note that the specific ports affected will depend on the storm's final track and intensity, which can change as the storm moves closer to the coastline.","Florida Keys, entire Florida west coast, later coastal GA and the Carolinas"

"The question asks for the time when Port Everglades, FL will most likely begin experiencing tropical storm conditions due to Hurricane Elsa. Based on the information provided in the advisory, it is not possible to provide an exact number of hours as the advisory does not mention Port Everglades specifically.

Explanation:

* For the next 12 hours (0-12 hour forecast), there is a 50% chance of gale force winds occurring in areas covered by the Tropical Storm Warning or Watch, as Elsa is expected to move near or over portions of the west coast of Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday.
* For the next 24 hours (12-24 hour forecast), there is an 80% chance of gale force winds occurring in areas covered by the Tropical Storm Warning or Watch, as Elsa is expected to move across central Cuba tonight and approach the Florida Straits.
* For the next 48 hours (24-48 hour forecast), there is a 100% chance of gale force winds occurring in areas covered by the Tropical Storm Warning or Watch, as Elsa is expected to move near or over portions of the west coast of Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday.
* For the next 72 hours (48-72 hour forecast), there is still a 100% chance of gale force winds occurring in areas covered by the Tropical Storm Warning or Watch, as Elsa is expected to move near or over portions of the west coast of Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday.
* For the next 96 hours (72-96 hour forecast), there is a slightly lower chance (90%) of gale force winds occurring in areas covered by the Tropical Storm Warning or Watch, as Elsa is expected to move near or over portions of the west coast of Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday. However, it is still likely that some parts of the region will experience gale force winds during this timeframe.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '1%', 'in 48h': '7%', 'in 72h': '5%', 'in 96h': '1%'}"

The advisory suggests that the storm may produce tropical-storm-force winds (greater than 39 mph or 63 km/h) within the next few hours.

Regarding your question about when Port Everglades, FL might be affected by Elsa, it's not possible to give a specific date based on the information provided in the screenshot. The forecast suggests that Elsa is expected to move across the eastern Caribbean Sea tonight and possibly affect the southern coast of Hispaniola late Saturday or Saturday night. However, as tropical storms can change their trajectory and intensity rapidly, it's difficult to predict the exact timeline for any potential impact on Port Everglades, FL with certainty.
