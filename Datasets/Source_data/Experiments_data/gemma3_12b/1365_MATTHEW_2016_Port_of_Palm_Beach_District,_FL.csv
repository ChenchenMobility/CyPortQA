"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The provided text highlights ""Hurricane Matthew"" impacting the ""Florida east coast,"" and mentions ""Sebastian Inlet to Edisto Beach,"" which includes the Port of Palm Beach District. Given the severity described (life-threatening surge, widespread hurricane conditions), it's highly likely a significant number of vessels would be impacted and require port closure/rerouting. Considering the average daily vessel count and the potential for disruption, a higher impact number (20 or more) is the most plausible answer.",A.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory indicates potentially life-threatening inundation along the Florida east coast from Deerfield Beach to Fernandina Beach, along with dangerous surf and rip current conditions. Port of Palm Beach District falls within this impacted zone. Given the severity of the predicted hazards, it is highly likely that a significant number of vessels would be impacted and require maneuvering or sheltering, exceeding the average daily count.",A.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory states ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"" and ""life-threatening inundation"" are expected along the east coast of Florida, including the Port of Palm Beach District. Given the severity of the predicted conditions and the fact that port operations are highly susceptible to disruption, a significant number of vessels would likely be impacted, requiring port closure or diversion. Given the average daily number of vessels in the district, it’s logical to assume a large number of vessels would be impacted.",A.
"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Reasoning:**

The advisory mentions ""life-threatening inundation"" along the Florida east coast, including the area near Port of Palm Beach. Given that a significant number of vessels would be at risk from such an event, and considering the scale of Hurricane Matthew, it's highly probable that a substantial portion of the vessels would be impacted, necessitating their evacuation or securing. Given the level of warning, it's likely most would be evacuated.",A.
