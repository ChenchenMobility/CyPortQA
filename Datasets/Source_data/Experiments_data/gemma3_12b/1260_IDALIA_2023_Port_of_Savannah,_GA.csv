"Based on the provided text, there's no direct mention of the Port of Savannah or any specific impact on commercial vessels there. The advisory focuses on Cuba, the Yucatan Peninsula, and Florida. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the impact on Savannah's port.

Given the lack of information, the most reasonable assumption is that there would be minimal direct impact, although there could be some disruptions due to the broader weather system.

Therefore, the best choice is **A. None**.",D.
,D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

Here's why the answer is D, considering the information provided:

*   **Event Duration & Impact:** The forecast advisory indicates the tropical depression will impact the Yucatan Peninsula and potentially the Gulf Coast and Southeastern US. Savannah, GA, is on the Gulf Coast. The event is expected to last several days (Sunday and into next week).
*   **Disruption:** Tropical storm conditions (even minor) would significantly disrupt port operations. Ports would likely experience delays, reduced activity, and potentially closures.
*   **Average vs. Impact:** While the average daily number of vessels is around 15.4, a tropical event *disrupts* that average. It wouldn't be a situation where operations continue as normal. The wording implies a significant impact. A complete shutdown is not guaranteed, but a large disruption impacting 20 or more vessels would be reasonable.",D.

,"Mariners are reminded there are no safe havens in port; ports are safest when the inventory of vessels is at a minimum, and all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures."
"Based on the provided text, interests along the southeastern U.S. coast, including the Port of Savannah, should monitor the progress of Hurricane Idalia, as additional watches and warnings will likely be required later today. General vessel activity should be prepared for potential disruptions and follow any official instructions or warnings issued by local authorities.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must obtain Captain of the Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan.
,"Vessels that wish to remain in port must obtain permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia or Florida that cannot safely off-load and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should divert to an alternate port."
,"Mariners are reminded there are no safe havens in port; ports are safest when the inventory of vessels is at a minimum, and all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures."
"Given the potential for tropical storm conditions and associated hazards like elevated surf and rip currents extending up the southeastern U.S. coast, ocean-going and commercial vessels at the Port of Savannah should monitor weather updates closely and prepare for potential delays or restrictions to operations. It's recommended to heed guidance from local authorities and the National Weather Service regarding safe maneuvering and harbor entry.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must obtain Captain of the Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan.
