"Based on the provided graphics and advisories:

*   PortMiami, FL is not currently under a Hurricane Warning or Tropical Storm Warning, but there is a 10% chance of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds by Monday morning.
*   Vessel operators at PortMiami should closely monitor the progression of Hurricane Elsa and be prepared for potential tropical storm conditions by early next week.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of the arrival of hazardous winds should seek an alternate port.
"*   PortMiami, FL has a 17% chance of experiencing tropical storm-force winds (39+ mph) by 2 AM AST Wednesday, July 7th.

"Based on the provided forecast products, ocean-going and commercial vessels at PortMiami, FL should prepare for potential tropical-storm-force winds starting early next week, with a 16% chance of experiencing such conditions by Tuesday morning and a 23% chance by Wednesday morning. Given the increasing probabilities for tropical-storm-force winds, advisories suggest that vessel operations should be reviewed for potential disruptions and preparations for hurricane-force conditions should be considered if the storm track continues to bring Elsa closer to the Florida coast.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of the arrival of hazardous winds should seek an alternate port.

"* PortMiami should prepare for potential tropical storm force winds by securing all cargo, equipment, and vessels as Elsa is forecast to bring 34 kt winds with a 16% probability by Tuesday 2 AM AST.
* Further precautions may be necessary as there is a 3% probability of hurricane force winds reaching PortMiami by Wednesday 2 AM AST.",Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and all cargo transfer operations may continue.
"*   **Monitor for increasing winds and potential impacts:** While PortMiami currently has a low probability of experiencing tropical storm-force winds (39+ mph) within the next 120 hours (13% probability by 2 AM AST Wednesday), it is crucial to closely monitor Elsa's track and intensity.
*   **Prepare for potential disruption:** As Elsa is forecast to move near Jamaica and Cuba by Sunday, and its forecast track has some uncertainty, port operations should remain vigilant for any shifts in the forecast that could bring stronger winds or increased rainfall to the South Florida region.",Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and transfer operations may continue while Port Condition WHISKEY is in effect.

"Based on the provided data, PortMiami, FL has a low probability (12%) of experiencing tropical storm force winds (39+ mph) within the next 24 hours. Therefore, operational guidance for ocean-going and commercial vessels at PortMiami is likely to remain relatively unaffected for the immediate future.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of the arrival of hazardous winds should seek an alternate port.
