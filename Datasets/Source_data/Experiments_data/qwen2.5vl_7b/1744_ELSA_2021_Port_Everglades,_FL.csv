"Given the rapid movement of Hurricane Elsa towards the southern coast of Hispaniola and the expected deterioration of conditions, general vessel activity at Port Everglades, FL should be monitored closely for any potential impacts on shipping lanes or port operations. Vessel operators should stay informed of any local advisories and take necessary precautions to ensure safety and compliance with maritime regulations.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of the arrival of hazardous winds should seek an alternate port.
"Based on the current weather conditions and context, general vessel activity at Port Everglades, FL, should be monitored closely, as the hurricane Elsa is expected to pass near or over portions of the Windward Islands and the southern Leeward Islands, potentially affecting wind and wave conditions in the area.","Vessels wishing to remain must contact the Captain of the Port, obtain permission, and submit a written safe-mooring plan; drawbridges may not operate once sustained winds reach 25 mph or during an evacuation; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida that cannot offload and depart within 24 hours before threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"Given the rapid movement of Hurricane Elsa towards the southern coast of Hispaniola and the expected deterioration of conditions there, ocean-going and commercial vessel activity at Port Everglades, FL should be closely monitored for any potential impacts on shipping lanes and port operations.

"Given the current weather conditions and the forecast for Elsa moving west-northwestward, the most likely future operational guidance for general vessel activity at Port Everglades, FL in the next 12 hours would be to monitor the storm's progress and prepare for potential impacts such as high winds and rough seas, which could affect navigation and port operations.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to offload and depart within 24 hours of the arrival of hazardous winds should seek an alternate port.
"Given the current hurricane Elsa's proximity to the Windward Islands and its projected path, general vessel activity at Port Everglades, FL, which is located in the southeastern United States, is likely to be unaffected by the hurricane's direct impact.
