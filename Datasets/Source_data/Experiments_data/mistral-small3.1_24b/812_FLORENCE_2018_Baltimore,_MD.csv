Flooding.,"Inland flooding upstream along the Susquehanna and Potomac basins could lead to high river flows in the Bay later next week, affecting barge traffic and reducing bridge clearances."
River flooding,High waves and dangerous rip currents on Chesapeake Bay; potential river‐flood rises on the Susquehanna and Patapsco due to upstream rainfall.
Flooding and rip currents.,Elevated seas and long-period swells could disrupt vessel approaches and create dangerous rip currents along Maryland beaches.
Rip currents.,Fresh-water river flooding and saturated ground that could hinder cargo handling and landside access.
Coastal flooding.,Fresh-water flooding may impede truck/rail access to the marine terminals; reduced visibility and debris on channels from runoff could disrupt vessel movements.
Coastal flooding,Freshwater river flooding and prolonged port-side disruptions from heavy rain and gusty winds.
Tornadoes may occur as a result of thunderstorms embedded in the storm's outer bands.,Fresh-water flooding of rivers feeding Chesapeake Bay; extended periods of elevated seas disrupting vessel movements and cargo handling
Tornadoes and rough seas.,River/creek flooding and possible debris flow could disrupt landside transport to the port
Rip Current,"Elevated waves and dangerous rip currents in Chesapeake Bay, possible river flooding impacting port logistics."
Coastal flooding and rip currents.,Dangerous surf and rip currents expected along the Maryland beaches well ahead of the storm.
