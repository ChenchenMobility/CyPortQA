"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for Virginia, VA, Port of, we need to examine the provided forecast data for relevant locations in Virginia. The relevant locations in the data are:

- Norfolk, VA (likely representing the Port of Virginia)
- Virginia Beach, VA

Let's analyze the data for these locations:

1. The highest value in any time interval will indicate the period with the highest probability of 34-kt winds.

For Norfolk, VA:
- 0-12 hours: 1 (1%)
- 12-24 hours: 3 (3%)
- 24-48 hours: 32 (32%)
- 48 hours or more: X (0%)

For Virginia Beach, VA does not have a 34-kt wind probability listed.

Based on the data, the highest 34-kt wind probability for Norfolk, VA is in the 24-48 hours interval.
