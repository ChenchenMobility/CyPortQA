"**D. 20 vessels or more**

Here's why:

*   **Storm Surge and Wind:** The forecast explicitly mentions a ""storm surge inundation of 1 to 2 feet above ground level"" and ""tropical storm conditions"" expected. These conditions would severely disrupt port operations.
*   **Charleston's Significance:** Charleston is a major port, handling a significant amount of cargo. A disruption of this magnitude would impact a substantial number of vessels.
*   **Event Duration:** The event is projected to last at least a full day, impacting multiple daily schedules.
*   **Average Vessel Count:** With an average of over 11 vessels per day, a disruption lasting a full day would likely exceed that number significantly when combined with the need to divert/delay more vessels to avoid the storm.",A.
"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Event Duration:** The advisory mentions the depression will impact the area ""later tonight or early Sunday."" This suggests roughly a 12-18 hour window.
*   **Impact:** The advisory mentions tropical storm conditions, wind hazards, rainfall, and storm surge. These conditions would significantly disrupt port operations.
*   **Vessel Disruption:** A port experiencing tropical storm conditions would likely see a complete or near-complete shutdown of vessel operations for safety.
*   **Average Daily Vessels:** The average is about 11 vessels per day.
*   **Likely Scenario:** Given the disruption, a significant portion of the expected vessels (likely more than 10) would be delayed or diverted. However, a complete evacuation of all vessels isn't necessarily expected.

Based on these factors, the most likely answer is **C. 10-20 vessels**.",A.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Explanation:**

The advisory mentions ""tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the warning area by Saturday night or early Sunday."" Given the number of vessels that pass through the Port of Charleston, and the potential for disruption caused by tropical storm conditions, it is highly likely that more than 20 vessels would be impacted.",A.
C. 10-20 vessels,A.
