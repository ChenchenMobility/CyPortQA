"The image shows that tropical storm Jerry is currently about 275 miles southwest of Bermuda and has maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Since the text mentions ""tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours,"" it can be inferred that St. Croix, VI is most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions within the next 36 hours. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, this translates to approximately 9 hours from the time the message was generated (which seems to be around 5 am AST). However, without additional information such as the current position and speed of Jerry, it is not possible for me to provide a more accurate estimate.",
