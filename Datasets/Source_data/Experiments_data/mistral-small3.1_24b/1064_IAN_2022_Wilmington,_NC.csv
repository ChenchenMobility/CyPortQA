"The data provided does not include information for Wilmington, NC. Therefore, it is impossible to determine when the probability of 34-kt winds at Wilmington, NC rises above zero based on the given information.

Since the question requires a choice (A, B, C, or D), and Wilmington, NC is not listed, I'll have to infer based on typical hurricane forecast data patterns. Usually, probabilities start being reported within 0-24 hours for locations that are within the potential impact zone.

Given this, the best inference would be:
