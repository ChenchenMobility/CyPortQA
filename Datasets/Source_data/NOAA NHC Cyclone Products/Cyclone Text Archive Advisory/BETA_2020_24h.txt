DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beta was
located near latitude 27.6 North, longitude 94.8 West. Beta is
moving toward the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this
general motion is forecast to continue for the next day or so. A
decrease in forward speed and a sharp turn to the north and
northeast is expected Monday night and Tuesday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Beta will continue to move toward the central
coast of Texas and will likely move inland by Monday night. Beta is
forecast to remain close to the coast of southeastern Texas on
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast before Beta reaches the
Texas coast. Weakening is anticipated once Beta moves inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km)
from the center.
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated based on data from an
Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
San Luis Pass, TX to Sabine Pass, TX including Galveston Bay...3-5
ft
Port Aransas, TX to San Luis Pass, TX including Copano Bay, Aransas
Bay, San Antonio Bay, and Matagorda Bay...2-4 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA including Sabine
Lake and Calcasieu Lake...2-4 ft
Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA to Ocean Springs, MS including
Vermilion Bay, Lake Borgne, Lake Pontchartrain, and Lake
Maurepas...1-3 ft
Baffin Bay, TX to Port Aransas, TX including Corpus Christi Bay and
Baffin Bay... 1-3 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande to Baffin Bay, TX...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the tropical
storm warning area along the southwestern Louisiana coast and will
spread westward to the warning areas in Texas later this morning.
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm
watch area along the south Texas coast later today.
 
RAINFALL: Through Friday, Beta is expected to produce rainfall
accumulations of 6 to 12 inches with isolated totals of 15 inches
from the middle Texas coast to southern Louisiana.  Rainfall totals
of 3 to 5 inches are expected northward into the ArkLaTex region and
east into the Lower Mississippi Valley.   Flash and urban flooding
is likely, as well as minor to isolated moderate river flooding.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two could occur today near
the middle-to-upper Texas coast or the southwestern Louisiana coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by a combination of Beta and cold front
over the northern Gulf of Mexico will continue along the coasts of
Louisiana and Texas during the next couple of days.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
