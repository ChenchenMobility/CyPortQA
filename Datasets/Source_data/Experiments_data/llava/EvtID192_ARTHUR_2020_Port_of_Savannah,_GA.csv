"The image you provided appears to show a weather map or advisory related to Tropical Storm Arthur. It includes information about the current location and strength of the storm, its predicted path, and the areas under watch or warning for tropical storm conditions, such as coastal North Carolina.

The text at the bottom mentions that Arthur is expected to produce rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over coastal North Carolina tonight and Monday, with locally higher amounts. It also states that swells generated by Arthur are affecting portions of the southeast U.S. coast and are expected to spread northward along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast during the next day or two. These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts. The forecast suggests that the storm will turn away from the U.S. East Coast on Tuesday.

Regarding your question about the port's freight being affected by the storm, it is not possible to determine the duration of any potential impacts solely based on the information provided in the image.
