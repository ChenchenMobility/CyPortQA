"The data provided does not include specific information for Manatee County Port, FL. Therefore, I cannot calculate the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival for that location based on the given information.",22%
"Based on the provided data, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days is not directly listed. However, we can infer it from the probabilities given for nearby locations.

For Bradenton, FL (which is in Manatee County), the probabilities are:
- Day 1: X (0%)
- Day 2: 1 (1%)
- Day 3: 5 (5%)
- Day 4: X (0%)
- Day 5: X (0%)

Since Manatee County Port is likely to have similar conditions to Bradenton, we can use these probabilities. The cumulative probability is the sum of these probabilities:

0% + 1% + 5% + 0% + 0% = 6%

So the answer is 6.",15%

"The forecast for Manatee County Port, FL is not directly listed. However, Bradenton, FL, which is part of Manatee County, can be used as a reference. The forecast for Bradenton, FL shows the highest 34-kt wind probability in the interval ""D. 48 hours or more"".

Therefore, the answer is:
D. 48 hours or more",B.
C,C.
"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for Manatee County Port, FL, we need to look at the relevant data for Bradenton, FL, which is representative of Manatee County.

From the provided data:
- **0-12 hours**: X (no probability)
- **12-24 hours**: 13 (13% probability)
- **24-48 hours**: 18 (18% probability)
- **48 hours or more**: X (no probability)

The highest probability is in the **24-48 hours** interval.
