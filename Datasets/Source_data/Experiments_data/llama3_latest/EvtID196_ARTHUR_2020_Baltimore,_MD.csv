Waves.,Dangerous rip currents and elevated surf along the Delmarva and New Jersey beaches could disrupt harbor pilot and lightering operations
Hanna,Enhanced rip currents and rough near-shore seas along the Maryland Atlantic beaches may disrupt pilot transfer and lightering operations.
Tornadoes.,High surf and rip currents along the Maryland Atlantic shoreline could disrupt pilot transfers and lightering operations.
"Here is the answer:

Tornado hazard is expected to develop over the Mid-Atlantic region, including Baltimore, MD, as the system approaches.","Elevated seas and long-period swells could produce rough Chesapeake Bay and harbor conditions, increasing wave action on exposed berths and restricting small-craft operations."
