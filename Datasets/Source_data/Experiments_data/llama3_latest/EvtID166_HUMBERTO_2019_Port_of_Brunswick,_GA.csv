In this case, it's mentioned that ""X"" represents a probability less than 5%. Therefore, you won't find any probabilities greater than zero until you get to the 48-hour mark.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Start from the top of the forecast and scan down.
2. Look for the first time when the probability of 34-kt winds at Port of Brunswick, GA is not ""X"".
3. In this case, you won't find any probabilities greater than zero until you get to the 48-hour mark.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. 48 hours or more.",C.
