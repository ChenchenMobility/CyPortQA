"The image you've provided shows a track forecast cone from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicating the path and intensity of a tropical cyclone.

"The image you've provided is a screenshot of the National Hurricane Center (NHC) track forecast cone for Tropical Cyclone Delta. As an AI, I don't have access to real-time data or current track information for any tropical cyclones. However, I can tell you that in a typical NHC track forecast cone, the current eye of the tropical cyclone would be indicated by a red dot or symbol on the map. This point represents the center of the storm and is the most powerful part of the cyclone. The image does not contain the current eye of the tropical cyclone, as it appears to show a different storm track rather than Delta's.","25.3N, 93.5W"
"The image provided shows a map from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), showing the track and forecast cone for Tropical Cyclone Delta. However, according to the NHC advisories in the image, the eye of the tropical cyclone is not shown.

In the context of tropical cyclones, the eye is typically at the center of the storm, which is not visible on this map. The map includes the forecast cone, which indicates the expected path of the storm over a period of time. If you're asking for coordinates related to the storm's track and forecast information, I can provide those based on the advisories available in the image:

- Center position at 7 am CDT: '26.8N, 89.5W'
- Current position: '30.6N, 84.1W' (as of 7 am CDT)

Please note that these coordinates indicate the current location and track of the storm, not its eye. The eye is usually more focused than the overall storm and is often found in the central part of the cone.","23.7N, 92.3W"

If you can provide a new image or more information, I would be happy to help further!","22.3N, 90.2W"
