The image does not provide enough information to determine the specific location(s) under the TS and Hurricane warning. It only shows a general forecast for tropical storm Elsa.,"Hurricane Warning for Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines; Tropical Storm Warning for Martinique, southern Dominican Republic, entire coast of Haiti"
"The image provided is a screenshot from the National Hurricane Center's website, showing a map of the Atlantic basin with various storm paths and tracks. The tropical cyclone in question, currently named Tropical Storm Elsa, appears to be on its way across the Atlantic towards Florida.

To provide an accurate answer for the current eye (or center) of the tropical cyclone, I would need access to the most recent data from the National Hurricane Center or another reliable source that provides real-time information about the storm's position. However, as a visual AI assistant, I can infer from the image that Tropical Storm Elsa is located in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, likely near the point where the map shows the ""Current Eye"" of the tropical cyclone, which is not visible or labeled in the provided image.

Please note that for the most accurate and up-to-date information on the current location of a tropical cyclone, it is recommended to visit the National Hurricane Center's website (https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/) or other trusted meteorological sources.","26.6N, 83.1W"
"The image you've provided appears to be a hurricane track forecast from the National Hurricane Center. The current eyepiece location is not explicitly stated in the image. Typically, the cyclone's eye is located near the center of the storm on the map.

"32.4N, 77.6W","22.9N, 81.9W"
"The image you've shared shows a tropical cyclone named Elsa with an expected path. The image includes a map indicating its position at the time of tracking. The eye of the cyclone is likely to be in the central part of the storm, which is typically located at latitude and longitude values where the temperature difference between the core and the surrounding areas is minimal. However, without specific information about the exact time this image was taken or the current position of the storm, it's not possible for me to provide the coordinates of the eye.

Tropical cyclones, like other weather systems, are dynamic and can change position rapidly. It would be advisable to monitor official sources such as the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for the most up-to-date information on the current location and path of tropical cyclones.","21.4N, 80.7W"

The image also contains various text labels such as 'Tropical Storm Elsa', 'Forecast Track', 'Center of the storm does not show', and 'Watches and Warnings'.","17.8N, 74.7W"
"The image you've provided appears to be a weather map showing the path and intensity of a tropical cyclone. However, as a language model AI, I don't have the capability to interpret images or geographical locations directly from them.

"The image you've provided appears to be a map and it doesn't provide the exact current location of the tropical cyclone's eye in terms of latitude and longitude. However, if you are referring to the forecasted path of the tropical cyclone, according to the National Hurricane Center's Track Forecast Cone, the projected path is shown as a cone with various points along its trajectory. Without specific coordinates provided for those points, I cannot give you precise latitude and longitude information for the eye of the tropical cyclone at this time.","14.4N, 65.1W"
"The image displays a tropical cyclone forecast map from the National Hurricane Center. The current eye of the tropical cyclone is not visible on this particular map.
