DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaias was located
by NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 21.3 North, longitude 73.9 West. Isaias is moving toward 
the northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h), and a generally northwestward
motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected for the next
couple of days followed by a turn toward the north-northwest.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Isaias will move near or over the
Southeastern Bahamas today. Isaias is forecast to be near the
Central Bahamas tonight, and move near or over the Northwestern
Bahamas and be near or east of the Florida peninsula on Saturday and
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is possible today, and Isaias is expected
to remain a hurricane for the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km). A private weather observing site at Long Bay Beach
in Providenciales recently reported a sustained wind of 55 mph (86
km/h) and a gust to 59 mph (95 km/h).
 
Reports from the reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the minimum
central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Isaias can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC, and
on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by as
much as 3 to 5 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore
winds in the Bahamas.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue across portions of
the Dominican Republic and the Turks and Caicos this morning.  
Hurricane conditions are expected to begin in the southeastern 
Bahamas this morning and spread into the central and
northwestern Bahamas tonight and into Saturday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in Florida
beginning Saturday.
 
RAINFALL: Isaias is expected to produce the following rain
accumulations through Saturday:
 
Dominican Republic and northern Haiti: 4 to 8 inches, with isolated
maximum totals of 12 inches.
 
Bahamas, Turks and Caicos: 4 to 8 inches.
 
Cuba: 1 to 2 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 4 inches.
 
These rainfall amounts will lead to life-threatening flash flooding
and mudslides, as well as river flooding. Urban and small stream
flooding is expected for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Hispaniola.
 
From Friday night through Monday:
 
South Florida into east-Central Florida: 2 to 4 inches, with
isolated maximum totals of 6 inches.
 
These rainfall amounts could result in isolated flash and urban
flooding, especially in low-lying and poorly drained areas.
 
Heavy rains associated with Isaias may begin to affect the eastern
Carolinas by early next week. This rain could result in isolated
flash and urban flooding, especially in low-lying and poorly drained
areas, as well as isolated minor river flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaias are affecting portions of Puerto
Rico, the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the
southeastern Bahamas. These swells will spread along the coast of
Cuba and into the central and northwestern Bahamas later today and
along the east coast of Florida on Saturday. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
