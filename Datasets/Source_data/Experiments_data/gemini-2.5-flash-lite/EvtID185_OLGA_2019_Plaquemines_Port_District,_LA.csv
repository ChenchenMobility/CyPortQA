"The question asks about Plaquemines Port District, LA, but this location is not explicitly listed in the provided table. However, considering the geographic proximity of other Louisiana locations and the track of the tropical depression, we need to infer the most likely answer based on the available data.

Let's examine the probabilities for Louisiana locations:

*   **BATON ROUGE LA:** 15% (00Z Sat to 12Z Sat), X (all subsequent periods)
*   **MORGAN CITY LA:** 14% (00Z Sat to 12Z Sat), X (all subsequent periods)
*   **LAFAYETTE LA:** 17% (00Z Sat to 12Z Sat), X (all subsequent periods)
*   **NEW IBERIA LA:** 18% (00Z Sat to 12Z Sat), X (all subsequent periods)

These Louisiana locations show their highest probabilities in the ""00Z Sat to 12Z Sat"" period, which corresponds to the 12-24 hour forecast interval from the initial advisory time (1500 UTC Fri).

Given that Plaquemines Port District is on the coast of Louisiana, it's reasonable to assume it would experience similar or potentially higher impacts due to its coastal location. The highest probabilities for the listed Louisiana locations all fall within the 12-24 hour window.

Therefore, the most appropriate choice is B.
