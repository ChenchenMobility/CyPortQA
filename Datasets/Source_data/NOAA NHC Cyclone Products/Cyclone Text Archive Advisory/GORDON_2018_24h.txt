DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gordon was
located near latitude 27.3 North, longitude 85.0 West.  Gordon is
moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A
west-northwestward to northwestward motion with some decrease in
forward speed is expected over the next few days.  On the forecast
track, the center of Gordon will move across the eastern Gulf of
Mexico today, and will approach the north-central Gulf Coast within
the warning area late this afternoon or evening, and move inland
over the lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected today,
and Gordon is forecast to be a hurricane when it makes landfall
along the north-central Gulf Coast.  Rapid weakening is expected
after Gordon moves inland.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force reconnaissance
aircraft is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Shell Beach to Dauphin Island, Alabama...3 to 5 ft.
Navarre Florida to Dauphin Island, including Mobile Bay...2 to 4 ft.
Shell Beach to the Mouth of Mississippi River...2 to 4 ft.
Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Louisiana-Texas border...1 to
2 ft.

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area,
please see products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Gordon is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 8 inches over southwest Alabama, southern and central
Mississippi, southeastern and northeastern Louisiana, and southeast
Arkansas, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches through late
Thursday.  This rainfall may cause flash flooding.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin this
afternoon within portions of the warning area, with hurricane
conditions expected by this evening in the hurricane warning
area.
