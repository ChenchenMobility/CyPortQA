"The table does not contain information for the Port of Savannah, GA.",D.
"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for Port of Savannah, GA, we need to identify the relevant location in the Port of Savannah in the provided forecast data. Unfortunately, Port of Savannah is not directly listed in the provided data. However, so we'll need to use a nearby location for comparison. Savannah's closest listed location is Charleston, SC. We will use Charleston, SC data as a proxy for Port of Savannah, GA.

From the provided data:

**CHARLESTON SC  34**
- 0-12 hours: 2
 12-24 hours: 11
 24-48 hours: 2

 48 hours or more: 1

The highest probability is in the 24-48 hours interval.

"The provided data does not include information for the Port of Savannah, GA. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for that location based on the given information.",D.
"Based on the provided data, the highest 34-kt wind probability for Port of Savannah, GA is not directly listed. However, we can infer the closest relevant data from nearby locations. The closest relevant data is from the Gulf Stream coordinates and nearby coastal points. Since the exact data for Savannah is not available, we cannot definitively determine the highest probability interval.

However, given the typical progression of tropical systems, the highest wind probabilities often occur in the 24-48 hour range. Therefore, based on general forecasting patterns:

C. 24-48 hours",D.

However, if we were to infer based on the closest locations provided (e.g., Charlotte Harbor, FL or Jacksonville, FL), we could estimate. But since the question asks for an exact answer from the choices given and the data for Port of Savannah, GA is missing, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
