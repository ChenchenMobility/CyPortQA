"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Reasoning:**

The provided text mentions that Delta is expected to produce heavy rainfall and potentially impact the Gulf Coast. Beaumont, TX, is a major port city on the Gulf Coast. Given the expected heavy rainfall and potential disruption to shipping lanes, it is reasonable to assume that the number of commercial vessels at Beaumont would be significantly impacted and exceed the average daily number.",C.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The forecast indicates Delta will bring heavy rainfall to the central Gulf Coast, including Beaumont, TX, later this week. While the advisory doesn’t give specific numbers for vessel impacts, heavy rainfall and potential disruptions to port operations (due to storms) would likely lead to a significant increase in vessels seeking shelter or experiencing delays. Given the average daily vessel count and the severity of the expected weather, a substantial increase beyond the normal flow is probable.",C.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The provided text indicates that Hurricane Delta is expected to bring heavy rainfall across portions of the central Gulf of Mexico into the southeastern United States later this week into the weekend. Beaumont, TX is located on the central Gulf Coast. Significant disruptions to port operations are typical during hurricanes, which would severely impact the average daily vessel count. A disruption leading to a significantly reduced vessel count over several days would likely result in a total impacted number exceeding 20 vessels.",C.
"The provided text doesn't contain information about Beaumont, TX, or the impact of Tropical Storm Delta on commercial vessels there. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the number of impacted vessels.



**Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer from the information given.**",C.
