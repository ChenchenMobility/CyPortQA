Isolated reports of flash flooding are possible across Virgin Islands due to saturated soil conditions and heavy runoff from Franklin's outer rain bands.,Rough seas and dangerous rip currents in the Atlantic exposures beginning late Wednesday.
Flooded roads and low-lying areas due to inland flooding are likely on St. Croix.,Rough seas and rip currents in nearby coastal waters during mid-week.
Heavy cloudiness and scattered thunderstorms.,Localized minor flooding in poor-drainage areas possible during heavier showers
Isolated tornadoes may form near the core of Franklin as it approaches the Virgin Islands.,Occasional lightning in outer rain-bands; minor short-period swells in the Caribbean passage
"Tornadoes are a possible hazard associated with Tropical Storm Franklin's expected passage near the Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI.",Rough seas and dangerous rip currents in surrounding Caribbean waters may affect port operations.
"Lightning and thunderstorms are expected to become more frequent and intense across the Virgin Islands, including St. Croix, as Tropical Storm Franklin approaches.",Rough seas and rip currents in the Caribbean passages surrounding St. Croix may disrupt small-craft and ferry operations.
