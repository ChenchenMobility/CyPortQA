DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fay was
located near latitude 37.4 North, longitude 74.8 West. Fay is moving
toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h).   A northward to
north-northeastward motion at a faster forward speed is expected
over the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of
Fay is forecast to move near the mid-Atlantic coast today and move
inland over the mid-Atlantic or the northeast United States late
tonight or on Saturday.

Reports from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that 
the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast today and 
tonight while the center remains over water.  Weakening should begin 
after the center moves inland.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
to the northeast and southeast of the center.
 
The Air Force plane reported a minimum central pressure of 1002 mb 
(29.59 inches).
