DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cindy was
located near latitude 28.2 North, longitude 93.2 West. Cindy is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the
north-northwest is expected tonight and Thursday, with a turn toward
the northeast expected on Friday.  On the forecast track, the center
of Cindy will move inland over southeastern Texas or southwestern
Louisiana late tonight or early Thursday, then move near or over
extreme eastern Texas, western and northern Louisiana, and
southeastern Arkansas Thursday and Thursday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected before landfall, with
weakening expected thereafter.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure based on observations from
oil rigs near the center is 994 mb (29.36 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Cindy is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 9 inches with isolated maximum amounts up to 15 inches over
southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama, and
western portions of the Florida Panhandle through Thursday night.
This rainfall could cause life-threatening flash flooding in these
areas.

Rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches with isolated maximum amounts of
7 inches can be expected farther west across western Louisiana and
eastern Texas through Thursday night. Rainfall should spread
northeastward across Arkansas and into portions of the Tennessee
and Ohio Valleys through Friday, with total rain accumulations of
3 to 5 inches with locally higher amounts possible.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions should spread westward and
northward through the Tropical Storm Warning area this afternoon
through Thursday.

STORM SURGE:  Inundation of 1 to 3 feet above ground level is
expected along the coast in portions of the Tropical Storm Warning
area. Inundation of 1 to 3 feet above ground level is also possible
elsewhere along the coast from southeastern Louisiana to the western
Florida Panhandle in areas of strong onshore winds.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible into tonight from the far
western Florida Panhandle across southwestern Alabama, southern
Mississippi, and southern Louisiana.
