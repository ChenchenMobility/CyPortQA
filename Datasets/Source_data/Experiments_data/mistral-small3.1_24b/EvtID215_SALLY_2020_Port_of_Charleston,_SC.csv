Tornadoes are possible as the storm moves inland.,"Isolated brief tornadoes possible inland across the Southeast late week, but risk at Charleston is very low."
Tornadoes and rough seas,Elevated rip-current risk along the Southeast U.S. coast from distant swells.
Rip Currents.,Minor marine swell increase and rip-current risk late week.
Rip currents and high surf are possible.,Elevated rip-current risk along southeastern U.S. beaches.

"Tropical Storm Sally is expected to be moving over the Gulf of Mexico and approaching the north-central Gulf Coast. Given the forecast track and the location of the Port of Charleston, SC, the impacts on freight are not expected to start until the storm moves further north. The storm is forecasted to approach the north-central Gulf Coast by late Monday and Tuesday, September 14-15, 2020. However, the Port of Charleston, SC, is far enough north that direct impacts are not expected until the storm has moved inland and weakened. Therefore, the expected start of impact on freight at the Port of Charleston, SC, would likely be around:
