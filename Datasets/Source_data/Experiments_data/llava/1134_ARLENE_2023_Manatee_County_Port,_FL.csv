However, as a language model AI, I can tell you that the location of the landfall is an important aspect of cyclone and port operations analysis, and it helps in preparing for the impact of the storm. The National Hurricane Center provides regular updates on the tracks and intensity of tropical cyclones, which can help in decision-making related to port operations and evacuation plans.",Central eastern Gulf of Mexico well offshore; no direct coastal impacts expected for the Florida peninsula
