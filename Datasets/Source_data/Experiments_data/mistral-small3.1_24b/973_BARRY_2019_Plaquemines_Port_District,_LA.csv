"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days, we need to identify the relevant data points from the provided table. Plaquemines Port District, LA is not explicitly listed, but we can use the data for nearby locations such as New Orleans, LA, or other relevant points in southeastern Louisiana.

Given that Plaquemines Port District is near New Orleans, we can use the data for New Orleans, LA. The cumulative probabilities for 34-kt winds at New Orleans, LA are as follows:

- Day 1: 0%
- Day 2: 1%
- Day 3: 4%
- Day 4: 27%
- Day 5: 32%

To find the cumulative probability over the next 5 days, we sum these probabilities:

0% + 1% + 4% + 27% + 32% = 64%

However, since the question specifically asks for the cumulative probability within the next 5 days, we need to consider the probability at the end of the fifth day. The table provides the cumulative probability at the end of each day, so the answer is:

32",43%
10,28%
22,30%
5,5%
4,4%
0.19,10%
"The cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days is 25.",10%
"To find the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days, we need to look at the relevant data for ""Plaquemines Port District, LA"" at the 50-kt wind speed threshold.

Since ""Plaquemines Port District, LA"" is not explicitly listed, we need to consider the nearest relevant locations, which are likely ""Grand Isle, LA"" or ""New Orleans, LA"". However, neither of these are listed either.

Given the absence of specific data for ""Plaquemines Port District, LA"", we cannot provide an exact cumulative probability based on the provided table.

If we were to estimate based on nearby locations such as ""Grand Isle, LA"" or ""New Orleans, LA"" or other similar coastal areas in Louisiana, we would need to interpolate or extrapolate the data, which is not feasible without additional context or data.

Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given information.",5%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days, we need to locate the relevant data in the provided table. Plaquemines Port District, LA is not explicitly listed, but we can use the data for nearby locations to estimate the probability.

The closest listed locations.

Given that Plaquemines Port District is near New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico, we can use the data for Grand Isle, LA (GFMX 280N 9W) as a proxy:

For Grand Isle, LA (GFMX 280N 90W):
- 50-kt wind arrival probabilities are not explicitly listed for Grand Isle, LA. However, we can use nearby locations such as Cameron, LA or Galveston, TX for estimation.

For Cameron, LA:
- Day 1: X
- Day 2: X
- Day 3: 18
- 18
- Day 4: 23
- Day 5: 4

Summing these probabilities:
18 + 23 + 4 = 4 = 45

Thus, the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days is approximately 45.

"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for Plaquemines Port District, LA, we need to look at the provided data for ""BURAS LA"" (which is part of Plaquemines Port District).

The probabilities for each time interval are as follows:
- 0-12 hours: 0
- 12-24 hours: 0
- 24-48 hours: 12
- 48 hours or more: 21

The highest probability is in the ""48 hours or more"" interval.

Therefore, the answer is:
D. 48 hours or more",D.
