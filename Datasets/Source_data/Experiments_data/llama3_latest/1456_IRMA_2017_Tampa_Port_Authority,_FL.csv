D. 20 vessels or more,A.
"Based on the information provided, there is no specific data on the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Tampa Port Authority, FL over the entire event. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the average number of vessels daily.

Given that the average number of vessels daily is 10.03985397, and considering that Irma's impact will likely affect the port for a period of time (e.g., 1-3 days), let's assume a moderate disruption to vessel traffic.

A reasonable estimate would be around 50% reduction in vessel traffic during the event. This means:

* Average daily vessels: 10.03985397
* Reduction in vessel traffic due to Irma: 5 vessels per day (50% of average)

Considering the duration of the event, we can estimate a total impacted number of commercial vessels at Tampa Port Authority as follows:

* Total days affected by Irma: assume 2-3 days for this example
* Vessels affected daily: 5 vessels (as estimated above)
* Total vessels impacted during the entire event: 5 vessels/day x 2.5 days (average of 2-3 days) = 12.5 vessels

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Tampa Port Authority, FL over the entire event is:
