"Based on the information provided, I estimate that it will take around 3-5 days for the port's freight to recover from the impact of Tropical Storm Fay.

Port operations were likely disrupted due to strong winds and heavy rainfall associated with the storm, resulting in delays and potential damage to infrastructure and equipment. As the storm moves inland, conditions are expected to gradually improve, allowing for a gradual recovery of port operations over the next few days.

Keep in mind that this is just an estimate based on general storm characteristics and may vary depending on specific circumstances at each port location.",None
