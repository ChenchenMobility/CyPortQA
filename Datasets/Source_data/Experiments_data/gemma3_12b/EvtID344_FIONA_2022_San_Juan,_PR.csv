"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory highlights several factors that would significantly disrupt shipping:

*   **Hurricane Conditions:** San Juan, PR is under a hurricane warning, leading to port closures and vessel delays.
*   **Heavy Rainfall & Flooding:**  The forecast of 12-16 inches of rain (with local maximums of 20 inches) would cause severe flooding and disrupt port operations.
*   **Storm Surge:** Potential for localized coastal flooding would further impede vessel movement.
*   **Overall Disruption:** The combination of these factors would lead to a large-scale disruption of shipping, and with an average daily number of vessels around 12, it's reasonable to expect significantly more than 20 vessels affected during the entire event.",A.

,A.
"B. 1-10 vessels



**Explanation:**

Here's the reasoning:

*   **Tropical Storm Warning:** San Juan, PR is under a Tropical Storm Watch, which means conditions are *possible* but not guaranteed.
*   **Event Duration:** The advisory indicates impacts late Saturday into Sunday. This is a relatively short period.
*   **Average Vessels:** The average daily number of vessels (11.75) suggests a steady flow, but a tropical storm warning would likely cause some disruption.
* **Disruption:** The storm surge and winds, combined with a risk to ship operations.
* **Limited Impact:** While it's possible some vessels would delay or would.
