further weakening at a faster rate expected early next week.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Rosa will affect portions of the coasts
of southwestern Mexico, the southern Baja California Peninsula, and
southern California late this week and over the weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
