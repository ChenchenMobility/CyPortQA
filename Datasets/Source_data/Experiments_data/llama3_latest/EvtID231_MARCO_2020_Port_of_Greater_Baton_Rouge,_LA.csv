"A nice challenge!

After carefully analyzing the text, I extracted the relevant information:

* The forecast is for a 34-knot (kt) wind arrival.
* The location is Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA.
* The time frame is within the next 5 days.

From the text, I found the following probabilities:

* Day 1: X (unknown)
* Day 2: X (unknown)
* Day 3: X (unknown)
* Day 4: 9% (12/13)
* Day 5: X (unknown)

To calculate the cumulative probability, I added up the probabilities for Days 4 and 5, assuming they are independent events. However, since Days 1-3 have unknown probabilities (X), I will conservatively assume a probability of 0 for each day.

The cumulative probability is:

0 + 0 + 0 + 9% + 0 = 9%

So, the answer is: **9**",21%
