"Tornadoes will be possible along the west central Florida coast through tonight. The tornado threat will also spread northward into the Florida Big Bend tonight, and toward southeast Georgia and the coastal Carolinas Wednesday.",Dangerous rip currents and higher surf along Gulf beaches
The image shows a tropical cyclone tracking chart from the National Hurricane Center. It indicates that Idalia has become a hurricane and is expected to rapidly intensify into an extremely dangerous major hurricane before landfall on Wednesday.,Elevated surf and rip-current risk along the central Gulf Coast
The possibility of flooding in low-lying areas near the coastline due to high tide combined with storm surge is an additional hazard associated with the potential for other dangerous conditions.,High surf and dangerous rip currents along Alabama beaches beginning mid-week.
"The image does not provide information on any additional hazards associated with the possible future storm at Mobile, AL.",Elevated rip-current risk along Alabama beaches through mid-week
"Possible hazards include coastal erosion, flooding in low-lying areas, damage to infrastructure, and disruption of transportation.","Brief squalls could temporarily reduce visibility and disrupt port traffic, but significant hazards are not anticipated at Mobile, AL under the current forecast track."
Floods could occur in low-lying areas due to rising water levels.,Increased surf and rip-current risk along Alabama beaches Tuesday–Thursday.
"The image does not show any additional hazards for Mobile, AL.",Deteriorating sea state in eastern Gulf could impact inbound/outbound vessel scheduling even though direct impacts are limited.
