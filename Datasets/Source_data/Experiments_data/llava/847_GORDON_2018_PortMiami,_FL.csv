"The image shows that there is a potential tropical cyclone called 'Seven' in the Caribbean Sea near Marathon, Florida. According to the image, the disturbance is moving toward the west-northwest and is forecast to pass over the Florida Keys or the southern portion of the Florida peninsula today. It is expected to become a tropical storm by tonight.

Based on this information, it can be inferred that PortMiami, FL is most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions sometime between today and tonight. However, without additional information such as the exact time and the track of the cyclone, it is not possible to provide a precise number indicating when exactly PortMiami will experience these conditions.",42
