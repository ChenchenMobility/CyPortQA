DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of the newly-formed Tropical
Depression Five-E was located near latitude 13.2 North, longitude
98.9 West. The depression is moving toward the west-northwest near
13 mph (20 km/h), and this motion is expected to continue during the
next couple of days.  On this forecast track, the core of the
cyclone is expected to remain offshore of the coast of Mexico.
However, a small deviation to the north of the track could bring
stronger winds to the coast.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is forecast, and the depression could become a
tropical storm later today.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The depression could produce areas of heavy rain along
the southern and southwestern coast of Mexico during the next
couple of days.

SURF:  Swells generated by the system are expected to increase near
the southern and southwestern coast of Mexico during the next few
days, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
