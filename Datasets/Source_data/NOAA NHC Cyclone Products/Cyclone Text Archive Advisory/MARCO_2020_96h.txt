DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Fourteen 
was located near latitude 14.3 North, longitude 81.0 West.  The 
depression is moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn 
toward the west-northwest and northwest with a decrease in forward 
speed is forecast on Friday, with a general northwest motion 
continuing through at least Sunday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of the system will move near or over extreme northern 
Nicaragua and northeastern Honduras, including the Bay Islands, on 
Friday and approach the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of 
Mexico on Saturday.  The center is then expected to cross the 
Yucatan Peninsula Saturday night and move into the south-central 
Gulf of Mexico on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and
the depression is expected to become a tropical storm tonight.  The 
system could be near or at hurricane strength when it reaches the 
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico late Saturday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
