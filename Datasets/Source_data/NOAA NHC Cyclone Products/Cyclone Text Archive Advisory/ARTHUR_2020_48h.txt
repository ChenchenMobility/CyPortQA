DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression One 
was located near latitude 28.4 North, longitude 78.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the north-northeast near 13 mph (20
km/h) and this motion should continue during the next day or so.  
After that time, a faster northeastward motion is expected.  On 
the forecast track, the depression is expected to move offshore, 
but parallel to, the coast of Florida tonight, and then move near 
or east of the coast of North Carolina on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast, and the depression is expected 
to become a tropical storm on Sunday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations 
and earlier aircraft reconnaissance data is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area on Monday.
 
RAINFALL: The depression is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches over the central and northwest
Bahamas, and generally less than 1 inch over south Florida through
tonight.  The depression is also expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches over coastal North Carolina Sunday
night and Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of
the east coast of central and northern Florida.  These swells are
expected to spread northward during the next few days, and could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much
of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
