Tornadoes are possible.,Brief tornado threat and short-fuse marine squalls possible as the storm’s remnant center crosses nearby
Tornadoes are possible.,"Brief, isolated tornado threat cannot be ruled out as outer rain-bands sweep across New Jersey late Friday"
Tornadoes are possible.,High surf and dangerous rip currents; brief spin-up tornadoes can’t be ruled out as the storm exits
Surf and swells.,Elevated seas and swells may disrupt river/ocean pilotage; brief visibility reductions in heavy downpours; possible debris flow from upstream watershed raising Delaware River levels
Surf and rip current conditions.,Enhanced rip currents and rough surf along the New Jersey beaches.
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,"Rough seas and high surf could impact Delaware Bay approaches, leading to navigation restrictions or pilotage delays."
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,"Minor marine/riverine flooding possible if remnant rain bands stall, but confidence is low at this range."
