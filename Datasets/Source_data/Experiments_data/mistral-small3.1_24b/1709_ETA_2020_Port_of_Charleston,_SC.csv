"Based on the provided information, the port of Apalachicola is expected to experience tropical-storm-force winds starting around 72 hours from the forecast issuance (Thursday) and continuing through 96 hours (Friday) and potentially up to 120 hours (Saturday). Given the potential for significant impacts and the need for assessments and repairs, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations may take approximately 3 days to recover fully.
