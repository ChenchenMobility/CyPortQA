"Based on the information provided in the image, Port of Savannah, GA is not explicitly listed in the data. However, the closest location that might be relevant is ""GFMX 290N 850W"" which represents an offshore point near Savannah.

Looking at the wind probabilities for ""GFMX 290N 850W"" at 34-kt:

- 0-12 hours: X (0%)
- 12-24 hours: X (0%)
- 24-48 hours: 9 (9%)
- 48 hours or more: 13 (13%)

The highest probability is in the 48 hours or more interval.

D. 48 hours or more",D.
"The table does not include specific data for the Port of Savannah, GA. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for that location based on the provided information.",D.
"Based on the information provided, the forecast for Port of Savannah, GA, is not explicitly included in the data. However, if we assume the closest relevant location is ""CHARLESTON SC,"" we can analyze the provided data:

- 0-12 hours: X
- 12-24 hours: X
- 24-48 hours: X
- 48 hours or more: 4

Given the data for ""CHARLESTON SC,"" the highest 34-kt wind probability is indicated in the interval ""48 hours or more.""
