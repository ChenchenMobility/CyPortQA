"* Wilmington, NC has a 23% probability of experiencing tropical storm-force winds by the morning of Thursday, September 13th.
* By the morning of Friday, September 14th, the probability of tropical storm-force winds increases to 81%, with a 42% chance of hurricane-force winds. Given these probabilities, vessel activity should be suspended and preparations made for severe weather.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"* Vessels should consider departing Wilmington, NC, or making preparations for departure as Hurricane Florence is forecast to bring tropical storm-force winds and higher by Friday, with a significant probability of exceeding 39 mph by Thursday and Friday.
* The probability of sustained winds of 50 kt or greater reaching Wilmington, NC, is 53% by 72 hours (12Z Thu to 12Z Fri) and 14% by 96 hours (12Z Fri to 12Z Sat), indicating a high likelihood of dangerous conditions.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"* Wilmington, NC has a 63% chance of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds (39 mph or greater) by 8 AM Saturday.
* Given the current forecast and the potential for significant storm surge and hurricane-force winds, port and facility operations in Wilmington, NC should be preparing for disruptions and implementing their hurricane preparedness plans.","Cargo and facility operations may continue; facility operators should activate hurricane plans, secure loose equipment, and prepare to suspend operations if conditions escalate."
"* There is a 69% probability of tropical-storm-force winds (39 mph) at Wilmington, NC within the next 12 hours (by 8 PM Mon Sep 10 to 8 AM Tue Sep 11).
* Given the increasing probability of tropical-storm-force winds, general vessel activity at Wilmington, NC should be suspended by the time in_12h, and all necessary preparations for hurricane conditions should be completed.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"*   Vessels at Wilmington, NC should anticipate the probability of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds (39 mph or greater) to increase to 91% within 24 hours.
*   Operations at Wilmington, NC should prepare for significant disruptions due to the high likelihood of experiencing hurricane-force winds (74 mph or greater), with a 50% probability forecast within 24 hours.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Based on the provided graphics and advisories, by the time 36 hours have passed from 8 PM AST Sunday, September 9th (which would be 8 AM AST Tuesday, September 11th), Wilmington, NC has a high probability (between 63% and 74%) of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds. Therefore, general vessel activity at Wilmington, NC at this time should anticipate significant disruptions due to the strong winds and associated conditions associated with Hurricane Florence.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"At 48 hours from the current forecast (12Z Tuesday), Wilmington, NC has a 50% chance of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds. Given this probability, general vessel activity at Wilmington, NC should be suspended and port operations should prepare for potential impacts.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"* Based on the Future Wind Probability Table, Wilmington, NC has a 69% chance of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds (39 mph) by 00Z Saturday (approximately 8 PM Friday AST).
* Given the increasing probability of sustained winds and the overall track forecast for Hurricane Florence, operational guidance for ocean-going and commercial vessels at Wilmington, NC would likely be to initiate preparations for port closure and consider suspending all port operations within the next 12 hours.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"*   Wilmington, NC has a 52% chance of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds (39 mph) by 8 AM AST Saturday, September 15th, and a 39% chance of experiencing hurricane-force winds (74 mph).
