DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beta was
located near latitude 25.8 North, longitude 92.2 West.  Beta is
moving toward the north-northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A slow
westward motion is expected to begin late today.  A slow
northwestward motion is forecast to begin late Sunday and continue
through late Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Beta will
slowly approach the Texas coast early next week.
 
Maximum sustained are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast, and Beta is expected to become a
hurricane on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Port Mansfield, TX to High Island, TX including Baffin Bay, Corpus
Christi Bay, Copano Bay, Aransas Bay, San Antonio Bay, Matagorda
Bay, and Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande to Port Mansfield, TX...1-3 ft
High Island, TX to Morgan City, LA including Sabine Lake, Calcasieu
Lake, and Vermilion Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch
area by late Monday or Monday night, with tropical storm conditions
possible by late Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible
within the tropical storm watch area along the upper Texas and
southwestern Louisiana coast as early as tonight.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm watch area
along the south Texas coast late Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  There is an increasing risk of heavy rainfall and
flooding along the northwest Gulf Coast Sunday through at least the
middle of next week as Beta is forecast to move slowly toward and
along or offshore of the coast through that time. For additional
information, see products from your local National Weather Service
office.
 
SURF:  Swells are expected to increase and reach the coast of Texas
and the Gulf Coast of Mexico later today, generated by a
combination of Beta and a cold front entering the northern Gulf of
Mexico.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
