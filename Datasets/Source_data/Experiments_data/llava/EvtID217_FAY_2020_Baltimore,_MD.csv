"Tropical storm-force wind speed probabilities for the storm by the end of 120 hours. The image shows a map of the United States, with a color gradient indicating the probability of tropical storm force winds (over 34 kt or 62 mph) for a given location. The cone is overlaid on the map, and there are two images: the first shows the map with the storm path in black, while the second image zooms in on a specific area, showing the storm's projected landfall location with an arrow pointing to it. The arrow is labeled with the word ""ONLY."" The text at the bottom of the image provides information about the storm, including its name, speed, and direction.","Mid-Atlantic coast from the lower Maryland Eastern Shore northward through Delaware, New Jersey and southern New England"

It highlights the forecast information for the storm, including its current position, movement, maximum sustained winds, and minimum central pressure. The map also indicates the affected coastal regions in the United States, including the mid-Atlantic coast from Cape May New Jersey to Watch Hill Rhode Island, with a tropical storm warning in place.",Brief coastal flooding along western Chesapeake tributaries and reduced visibility hindering cargo movements
