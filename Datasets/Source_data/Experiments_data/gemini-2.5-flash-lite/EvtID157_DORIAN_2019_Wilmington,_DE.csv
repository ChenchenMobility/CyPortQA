"The question asks for the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Wilmington, DE. However, the provided text lists ""Wilmington NC"" and ""Wilmington, DE"" is not present in the table.

Assuming you meant ""Wilmington NC"", the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival within the next 5 days is indicated in the parenthesis for the ""WILMINGTON NC 50"" row, under the ""18Z SUN"" column which represents the cumulative probability for the 5-day period (up to 120 hours).

The value is X(98). Since X indicates probabilities less than 1 percent, and we are looking for a percentage, and the parenthesis indicates cumulative probability, the answer is 98.
