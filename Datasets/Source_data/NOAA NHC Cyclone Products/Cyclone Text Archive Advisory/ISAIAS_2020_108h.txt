DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaias was
located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 68.5 West. Isaias is
moving toward the northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h), and a
west-northwestward to northwestward motion with some decrease in
forward speed is expected over the next couple of days.  On the
forecast track, the center of Isaias will move over Hispaniola later
today and near the Southeastern Bahamas by tonight or early Friday.
Isaias is forecast to be near the Central Bahamas Friday night and
approach the Northwest Bahamas or southern Florida Friday night and
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is anticipated until landfall in
Dominican Republic later today, with re-strengthening forecast on
Friday and Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km)
from the center. Tropical-storm-force winds are occuring along the 
southern coast of Puerto Rico. A Weatherflow station in Yabucoa 
Tanque de Agua reported sustained winds of 46 mph (74 km/h) with a 
gust to 56 mph (91 km/h).  A Weatherflow station at Las Mareas 
reported sustained winds of 43 mph (69 km/h) with a gust to 54 mph

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue across portions of
the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico through this
morning or early afternoon. These conditions are forecast to reach
portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti within the warning
area later this morning, and the southeastern Bahamas and Turks
and Caicos this afternoon.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
in the Central Bahamas beginning Friday morning and are possible in
the northwestern Bahamas beginning late Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Isaias is expected to produce the following rain
accumulations:
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos: 3 to 6 inches.
 
Puerto Rico and northern Haiti: 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum
totals of 8 inches.
 
Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches, with isolated maximum totals of
10 inches.
 
Bahamas: 4 to 8 inches.

and mudslides, as well as potential riverine flooding beginning
today. Urban and small stream flooding is expected for the U.S.
Virgin Islands, eastern Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaias are affecting portions of
the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican
Republic, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern
Bahamas.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
