Tsunami and flooding from heavy rainfall in the surrounding areas could impact the port.,Minimal—isolated thunderstorms; tornado risk remains well south of the port
"Tsunami warnings are not applicable to the Toledo-Lucas County Port, OH, as it is not located in a coastal area affected by the storm surge.","Low risk of an isolated tornado in southern Ohio Saturday, minor river rises possible but major impacts to port operations are not expected"
The potential for life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast.,Reduced visibility and standing water on terminal surfaces could briefly disrupt cargo/rail movements; otherwise minimal direct cyclone effects expected.
"The potential for large and destructive waves along the immediate coast near and to the right of the landfall location could impact the Toledo-Lucas County Port, OH.",None anticipated that would materially affect port operations
Tsunami,Brief thunderstorm squalls could cause temporary visibility reductions for vessel movements on the Maumee River
Tsunami,Brief reduced visibility and wet berths may slow cargo handling; otherwise minimal operational impact expected
"Swells generated by Laura are expected to affect the coastal waters near Toledo-Lucas County Port, OH.",None
"Swells generated by Laura are expected to affect the area, posing a risk to marine operations.","Localized ponding on roadways possible if heavier showers reach NW Ohio, otherwise none"
"Swells generated by Laura are expected to affect the northern coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Cuba, and much of the Bahamas.",Brief visibility reductions and ponding on terminal surfaces; otherwise no significant tropical-cyclone-related hazards expected.
"Swells generated by Laura are expected to affect the northern coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Cuba, and much of the Bahamas.",None
