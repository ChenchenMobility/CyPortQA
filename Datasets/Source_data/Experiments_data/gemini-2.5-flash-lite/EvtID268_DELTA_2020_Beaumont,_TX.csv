"The question asks for the first time the probability of 34-kt winds at Beaumont, TX rises above zero. Looking at the table, Beaumont, TX is not listed. However, there are several locations in Texas listed. Let's assume the question meant to ask about a listed Texas location where the probability of 34-kt winds rises above zero.

Reviewing the Texas locations:
*   **JASPER TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 1( 1) for 24-48 hours, and 11(12) for 48-72 hours.
*   **KOUNTZE TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 1( 1) for 24-48 hours, and 11(12) for 48-72 hours.
*   **PORT ARTHUR TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 1( 1) for 24-48 hours, and 17(18) for 48-72 hours.
*   **GALVESTON TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 5( 5) for 24-48 hours, and 17(22) for 48-72 hours.
*   **HOUSTON TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 1( 1) for 24-48 hours, and 8( 9) for 48-72 hours.
*   **AUSTIN TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, X( X) for 24-48 hours, and 2( 2) for 48-72 hours.
*   **FREEPORT TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 2( 2) for 24-48 hours, and 9(11) for 48-72 hours.
*   **GFMX 280N 950W**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 10(10) for 24-48 hours, and 18(28) for 48-72 hours.
*   **HIGH ISLAND TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 2( 2) for 24-48 hours, and 14(16) for 48-72 hours.
*   **MATAGORDA TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 4( 4) for 24-48 hours, and 10(14) for 48-72 hours.
*   **PORT O CONNOR**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 3( 3) for 24-48 hours, and 9(12) for 48-72 hours.
*   **ROCKPORT TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 1( 1) for 24-48 hours, and X( 5) for 48-72 hours.
*   **CORPUS CHRISTI**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 1( 1) for 24-48 hours, and X( 4) for 48-72 hours.
*   **GFMX 270N 960W**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 8( 8) for 24-48 hours, and 10(18) for 48-72 hours.
*   **HARLINGEN TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 1( 1) for 24-48 hours, and X( 3) for 48-72 hours.
*   **BROWNSVILLE TX**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 1( 1) for 24-48 hours, and X( 4) for 48-72 hours.
*   **GFMX 250N 960W**: Probability of 34-kt winds is X( X) for 0-24 hours, 9( 9) for 24-48 hours, and 7(16) for 48-72 hours.

For all the listed Texas locations, the probability of 34-kt winds is ""X"" for the first time period (0-24 hours), which indicates less than 1%. The probabilities rise above zero in the 24-48 hour or 48-72 hour time periods.

Let's re-examine the question and options. It asks for the *first time* the probability *rises above zero*.

If we consider any of the listed Texas locations that show a non-zero probability in the ""24-48 hours"" column, then that would be the first time the probability rises above zero, as the ""0-24 hours"" column consistently shows ""X"" (less than 1%).

Therefore, for many Texas locations, the probability rises above zero between 24-48 hours.
