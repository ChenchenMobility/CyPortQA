DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Zeta was
located by a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 18.7 
North, longitude 84.3 West. Zeta is moving toward the northwest 
near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A northwestward motion with an increase in 
forward speed is expected over the day or so, followed by a turn 
toward the north Tuesday night. A faster northward to 
north-northeastward motion is forecast on Wednesday.   On the 
forecast track, the center of Zeta will move near or over the 
northern Yucatan Peninsula later today or tonight, move over the 
southern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, and approach the northern Gulf 
Coast on Wednesday.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum 
sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast, and Zeta is expected to become a 
hurricane later this morning.  Additional strengthening is expected 
before Zeta moves over the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA 
reconnaissance aircraft data is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
