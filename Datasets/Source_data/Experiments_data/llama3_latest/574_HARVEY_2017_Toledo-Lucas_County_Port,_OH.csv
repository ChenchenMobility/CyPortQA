"A nice challenge!

After searching through the table, I found that there are no locations close to Toledo-Lucas County Port, OH (latitude: 41.66°N, longitude: 83.53°W). The closest location is likely a coastal or marine weather forecast point.

However, if we look at the grid points in the table, we can see that there are several points with coordinates ending in ""50W"" or ""60W"", which corresponds to roughly the same longitude as Toledo-Lucas County Port, OH. These locations are:

* GFMX 250N 960W
* GFMX 270N 960W
