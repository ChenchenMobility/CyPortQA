Swells generated by Arthur could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast.,"Elevated seas and long-period swells will increase wave heights and create strong rip currents, posing a navigational challenge for vessels entering or leaving Delaware Bay."
Swells generated by Arthur could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.,Dangerous surf and rip currents along nearby New Jersey and Delaware beaches; minor coastal flooding at high tide
Swells generated by Arthur could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.,Rough seas and elevated swells in nearby Atlantic and Delaware Bay could hamper pilot transfers and small-craft movements
Swells generated by the depression could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.,Elevated surf and dangerous rip currents along nearby New Jersey and Delaware beaches may affect maritime pilot transfers and small craft operations
