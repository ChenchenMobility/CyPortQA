"The image does not provide the current eye of the tropical cyclone, but it shows a track forecast cone from the National Hurricane Center and a graphic of tropical storm Hannah at 10:00 PM CDT on July 25, 2020.

"The image you've provided shows a map and a forecast track cone for a tropical cyclone, but it does not provide the current location of the eye of the storm. However, I can help you understand what the image is showing and what the terms used in the image mean.

The map shows the current position of the storm, which appears to be over the southeastern part of the United States. The forecast track cone represents the potential path of the storm as it moves across the country.

The image also contains various pieces of information:
- The name of the storm is indicated as ""Hanna.""
- The current location of the storm is given as ""32.4N, 77.6W,"" which corresponds to a region near Louisiana and Texas.
- There's a chart indicating the storm's intensity with a scale of 1-5, where 1 is minimal and 5 is catastrophic. The current intensity level for Hanna is marked as ""2.""
- A track forecast cone is shown, which indicates the potential path the storm might take over the next few days. This cone provides different probabilities of the storm's location at various times in the future. For example, the image shows that there's a 30% chance the storm will be located near Corpus Christi at 7 pm CDT on August 25th, a 50% chance it will be near Houston at 1 am CDT on August 26th, and an 80% chance it will be in Mexico near Brownsville at 7 pm CDT on August 26th.
- The image includes a note stating ""Note: The cone contains the probable path of the storm; however, this does not mean the storm will stay on this track or that the impact will be limited to this area."" This note emphasizes the uncertainty and potential for changes in the storm's trajectory and intensity.
- There is a legend explaining symbols like ""T,"" which stands for tornado watches, and various colored lines representing different levels of probability.
- The image also shows the National Weather Service logo, indicating that this information is being provided by the NWS.

The map highlights a cone that represents the possible path of the storm, and it is color-coded with different shades to indicate the likelihood of the cyclone making landfall in various areas.

The track forecast shows that the cyclone may make landfall near or over these coastal regions during its predicted life span from July 26th to August 3rd.

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Texas City, TX within the next 5 days cannot be determined solely from this table.",4%
"Based on the table provided, the 34-kt wind probability peaks at Texas City, TX at 18Z SAT for the forecast hour, which corresponds to 6:00 PM CDT (Central Daylight Time). To find out how many hours remain until this time, we need to convert CDT to UTC and subtract the current UTC time from it. The current UTC time is 0900Z, so the time difference between CDT and UTC is 5 hours. Therefore, the time remaining until the peak wind probability at Texas City, TX would be:

6:00 PM CDT - 0900Z = 17:00 PM CDT - 3:00 PM CDT = 4:00 PM CDT - 3:00 PM CDT = 1:00 PM CDT - 1:00 PM CDT = 12 hours.

"The time period for Texas City, TX in the image is from 06Z Fri to 18Z Tue. Since there are 24 hours in a day and 36 hours in a 6-hour forecast period, we need to convert the times to 6-hour intervals for the wind speed probabilities. The 6-hour forecast periods for Texas City, TX are as follows:

* 06Z Fri to 18Z Fri: 0 to 6 hours
* 18Z Fri to 06Z SAT: 24 to 36 hours
* 18Z SAT to 18Z SAT: 72 to 96 hours
* 18Z SUN to 18Z MON: 120 to 144 hours

To find the time period for the 34-kt wind probability peak at Texas City, TX, we need to find the 6-hour forecast periods that have a cumulative probability of at least 3 percent for 34-kt winds. The probabilities in the image are given as follows:

* 18Z Fri to 06Z SAT: 24(25)
* 18Z SAT to 18Z SAT: 3( 3)
* 18Z SUN to 18Z MON: 1( 3)

Therefore, the time period for the 34-kt wind probability peak at Texas City, TX is from 06Z Fri to 18Z SAT. Since there are 72 hours in this period, the wind speed probabilities will peak within the next 5 days and there are 72/6 = 12 hours remaining until the peak.",48

"The 50-kt wind probability peaks at Texas City, TX within the next 5 days at 18Z on Monday, July 27th at 06Z, which is 2 hours before the forecast time for the storm's center.
