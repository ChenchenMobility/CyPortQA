DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 11.7 North, longitude 50.3 West.  Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A west-
northwestward motion with some increase in forward speed is expected
during the next few days.  On the forecast track, the center of
Beryl will approach the Lesser Antilles over the weekend and cross
the island chain late Sunday or Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are estimated to be near 75 mph (120 km/h)
with higher gusts, but recent satellite images suggest that Beryl
is becoming less organized.  If this trend continues, then Beryl
may be downgraded to a tropical storm later this morning.  Due to
Beryl's small size, short-term changes in intensity, up or down,
could continue to occur over the next day or two, and Beryl could
still be near hurricane strength as it nears the Lesser Antilles.
Weakening is expected once Beryl reaches the eastern Caribbean Sea
on Monday, but the system may not degenerate into an open trough
until it reaches the vicinity of Hispaniola and the central
Caribbean Sea on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Beryl is a small hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up
to 10 miles (20 km) from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm or hurricane conditions are possible within
the watch areas by late Sunday or Monday.

RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches through Sunday across the southern Leeward Islands
and northern Windward Islands, including Guadeloupe, Dominica,
Martinique, St. Lucia, and Barbados. Elsewhere across the northern
Leeward and southern Windward Islands, rainfall amounts of 2 inches
or less are expected.
