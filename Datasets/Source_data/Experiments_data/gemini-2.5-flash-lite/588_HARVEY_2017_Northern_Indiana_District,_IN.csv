"The provided text does not contain any information about ""Northern Indiana District, IN"". Therefore, it is impossible to answer the question based on the given data. However, if we were to assume this is a trick question or there's a misunderstanding, and the question implies the probability of *any* location on the list, we would be looking for the first instance of a probability greater than zero. But this doesn't fit the specificity of ""Northern Indiana District, IN.""

Since I must choose from the provided options and the data is irrelevant to the stated location, I cannot provide a valid answer. If this were a real-world scenario, I would request clarification or additional data.

Given the constraint to answer with ONLY a choice, and acknowledging the impossibility of answering based on the provided data, I cannot proceed.",A.
