Given that the text does not provide specific information about Port of Charleston, SC, I will rely on general knowledge. In this case, it is common for tropical cyclones to produce strong winds near their center, which would indicate a higher likelihood of sustained 34-knot (64 km/h) winds in the initial hours after landfall.
