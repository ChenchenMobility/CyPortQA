"I cannot provide real-time or current weather information, nor can I view any images or graphics in this context. However, I can tell you that in general, a cyclone's landfall location is determined by its track and intensity. The expected landfall location would depend on the cyclone's current position, speed, and direction, as well as any potential changes in these parameters.

It is important to note that cyclone forecasting involves a degree of uncertainty due to the complex nature of weather systems and the limitations of models used for prediction.","Entire southeast U.S. coast from Florida through the Carolinas, then Mid-Atlantic and southern New England coast including Cape Cod–Maine as the system accelerates northeastward"
