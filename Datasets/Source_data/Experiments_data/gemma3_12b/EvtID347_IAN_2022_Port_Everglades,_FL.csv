"D. 20 vessels or more.

**Reasoning:**

The text indicates significant rainfall and potential hurricane conditions along the Florida coast. Port Everglades is in the path of this storm, and it is in an area that could be affected by swells, a direct consequence of the storm. Even if the port isn't directly hit, the disruption to shipping lanes and potential for damage would likely cause a significant number of vessels to seek shelter or avoid the area. 12.21813204 is the average number of vessels *daily*; given the severity of the predicted event, it's reasonable to assume that the number of vessels affected would exceed this average substantially.",B.
,B.
"A. None



**Explanation:**

The text focuses on wind, rainfall, and storm surge impacts. It does not mention any specific number of commercial vessels expected to be impacted at Port Everglades. Therefore, the most logical answer is that none are predicted to be impacted based on the information provided.",B.
