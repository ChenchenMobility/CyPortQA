HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Three can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and 
WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL:  The potential tropical cyclone is expected to produce
total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches with isolated amounts of 8 
inches across the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.  Rainfall totals of 
4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches are 
possible beginning Friday and continuing through the weekend from 
the Central Gulf coast northeastward into the Southern Appalachians. 
This will likely produce areas of flash, urban, and small stream 
flooding as well as minor to isolated moderate river flooding with 
new and renewed rises on already elevated rivers.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will 
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising 
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Intracoastal City, LA to MS/AL Border...2-3 ft
Vermilion Bay and Lake Borgne...2-3 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...1-2 ft
MS/AL border to AL/FL border including Mobile Bay...1-3 ft
Cameron, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...1-2 ft

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge 
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For 
information specific to your area, please see products issued by 
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area on Friday, making outside 
preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
TORNADOES: The threat for a couple tornadoes should begin Friday
afternoon across coastal Louisiana.  This threat should expand
northward across southern portions of Louisiana and Mississippi, and
southwest Alabama on Saturday.
