"The expected start of impact on freight at Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI is 04-11-2021.",11/3/2022
The next intermediate advisory at 100 AM EST will be issued on Wednesday.,11/3/2022
"The image you have provided appears to be an official forecast or advisory from the National Weather Service (NWS) regarding Tropical Storm Nicole. It includes information about the current location and movement of the storm, as well as wind speeds, potential impacts on land, and safety precautions.

According to the image, the center of Tropical Storm Nicole was located near latitude 27.8 North, longitude 72.7 West at 1000 AM EST (1500 UTC), and is moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h). The storm is expected to continue on a west-to-west-southwest motion through Wednesday, with a turn toward the northwest and north-northwest on Thursday and Thursday night.

The image indicates that Nicole will approach the northwestern Bahamas today and tonight, move near or over those islands on Wednesday, and approach the east coast of Florida within the hurricane warning area Wednesday night. The storm is forecast to be near or at hurricane strength by Wednesday and Wednesday night while it is moving near the northwestern Bahamas and approaching the east coast of Florida.

The NWS advisory also mentions that Nicole is a large tropical cyclone, with wind speeds reaching up to 50 mph (85 km/h) in some areas. The storm will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the Florida Peninsula and southeast Georgia, which could lead to flash and urban flooding, as well as possible renewed river rises on the St. Johns River.

The advisory also warns about the potential for life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the east coast of Florida and much of the southeastern United States coast due to large swells generated by the storm.

It is important to note that this information is based on the forecast at the time the image was created (1000 AM EST), and actual conditions may differ as the storm develops.",11/3/2022

"The image you've provided shows a map of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, with Tropical Storm Nicole depicted as a small cyclone moving towards the west-southwest. The map indicates that the storm is expected to make landfall near or over the northwestern Bahamas on Wednesday, move near or over eastern Florida late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning, and then across central and northern Florida into southern Georgia on Thursday and Thursday night.

The map also shows the extent of tropical-storm-force winds, which are expected to reach up to 380 miles (610 km) from the center of the storm. It notes that the minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft observations is 984 mb (29.06 inches).

The key messages for Nicole, as provided in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, indicate that hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area along the east coast of Florida Wednesday night or Thursday morning, with tropical storm conditions expected by tonight or early Wednesday within the tropical storm and hurricane warning areas. Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area on Wednesday night and Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are also possible within the watch area along the west coast of Florida by Wednesday night.

The map shows that Nicole is expected to produce heavy rainfall, with amounts up to 3 to 5 inches across parts of the northwestern Bahamas and eastern, central and northern portions of the Florida Peninsula. It notes that flash and urban flooding will be likely in these areas, along with possible renewed river rises on the St. Johns River.

The map also indicates that there is a possibility of tornadoes from Wednesday night into Thursday across parts of eastern Georgia and eastern South Carolina, and large swells generated by Nicole are expected to affect the northwestern Bahamas, the east coast of Florida, and much of the southeastern United States coast during the next several days.
