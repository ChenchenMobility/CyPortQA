"The image you've provided appears to be a satellite image overlaid with various meteorological data and does not specifically show the current eye of a tropical cyclone like Hurricane Delta.

"The image provided does not explicitly show the current eye of the tropical cyclone. However, based on typical locations for the eye of a hurricane, it is expected to be near the center of the storm, which is often indicated by the innermost circle on a radar map. In this case, the image shows a large storm over Cuba and the southeastern United States with an innermost circle representing the area of maximum wind speed. The coordinates for the eye in such cases would typically be around the center of the storm's circulation, which could be somewhere within the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea.","17.8N, 82.0W"

The map also indicates that the storm is moving towards the northeast with a potential landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula on October 10th. Please note that this information may change as the storm's path and intensity evolve.

"The question asks about the most likely time for Corpus Christi, TX to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions. The image shows that at 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), Hurricane Delta was located near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 82.0 West and is moving toward the west-northwest. It is expected to move over the northeastern portion of the Yucatan peninsula early Wednesday. Based on this information, Corpus Christi, TX is most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions around 1200 UTC or 6:00 AM CDT on Wednesday morning. The image also shows that tropical storm conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands today and in Cuba tonight, with possible conditions near the same time.
