"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory explicitly mentions hurricane conditions are possible along the central Gulf Coast by late Tuesday or Tuesday night, impacting areas including Jacksonville, FL. Given the potential for severe weather, disruptions to port operations are highly likely. With an average of nearly 10 vessels daily, a significant event like this would easily disrupt that average, resulting in more than 20 vessels impacted overall.",A.
