"D. 20 vessels or more.

**Explanation:**

The forecast details significant impacts including heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and potentially life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Baja California Peninsula and extending towards Southern California including San Diego. A significant disruption of this magnitude would likely impact port operations. Given the severity of the forecast, a disruption of this scale would likely affect more than 10-20 commercial vessels to have affected the San Diego port.",A.
B. 1-10 vessels,A.
A. None,A.
A. None,A.
"A. None



**Reasoning:**

The advisory and discussion specifically mention potential impacts on the coasts of Mexico and the Baja California peninsula. San Diego Unified Port is located further north and not directly in the predicted path or area of significant impact. The swells are expected to reach Baja California by Tuesday, and the advisory doesn't indicate a direct threat to San Diego. Therefore, the number of impacted vessels is likely to be minimal to none.",A.
