tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside

and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Zeta was
located near latitude 17.7 North, longitude 83.4 West.  Zeta has 
been meandering or nearly stationary, but a generally northwestward
motion is expected over the next couple of days.  On the forecast
track, the center of Zeta will pass south of western Cuba early
Monday and move near or over the northern Yucatan Peninsula or the
Yucatan Channel late Monday, move into the southern Gulf of Mexico
on Tuesday, and reach the central Gulf of Mexico by late Tuesday.
 
Reports from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that 
the maximum sustained winds have increased near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next 48 
hours, and Zeta is expected to become a hurricane before it moves 
near or over the Yucatan Peninsula late Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 999 mb (29.50 inches).

RAINFALL: Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with local amounts of 12

Cuba,  and the northeast Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.  Additional
rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with local amounts of 5 inches
possible across Southern Florida and the Keys over the next 2 days,
with isolated storm totals of 8 inches.
 
By Wednesday, heavy rainfall associated with Zeta will begin to
affect the central Gulf Coast region, which may lead to flash
flooding in urban areas.

Warning area in the Yucatan Peninsula by late Monday.  Tropical
storm conditions could occur in the warning area in Western Cuba on
Monday.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by

coast in the Hurricane Warning area near and to the north of where
the center makes landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula.
