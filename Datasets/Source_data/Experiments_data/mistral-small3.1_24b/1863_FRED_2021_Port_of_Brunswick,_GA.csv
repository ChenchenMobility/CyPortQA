"Based on the provided data, the port of Apalachicola is expected to be significantly impacted by Tropical Depression Fred. The wind probability table indicates a high likelihood of tropical-storm-force winds (34 kt or higher) affecting the port, with a cumulative probability reaching 26% by 72 hours (00Z Tue) and remaining at 27% by 96 hours (00Z Wed). Additionally, the forecast track and wind probability graphic suggest that the port will be within the areas of potential tropical-storm-force winds for an extended period.

Given the expected wind impacts and the forecast track, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations may take approximately 3 days to recover fully, considering the time needed for the storm to pass, conduct safety inspections, and resume operations.

The information provided indicates that the storm is expected to impact the Florida Keys and southern Florida starting around Saturday, with tropical storm conditions possible beginning Friday night. The storm is forecast to move through the region over the next few days. Given the typical recovery time for ports after a tropical storm, which includes assessing damage, clearing debris, and restoring operations, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations would recover within approximately 1 day after the storm passes.",None
