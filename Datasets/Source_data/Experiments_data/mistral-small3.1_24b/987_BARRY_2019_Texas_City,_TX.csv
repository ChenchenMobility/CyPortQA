"The cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Texas City, TX within the next 5 days is not explicitly provided in the given data. However, based on the data for similar locations like Galveston, TX, and High Island, TX, which are nearby, we can infer that the probability might be around 17%. But since Texas City, TX is not listed, I cannot provide an exact number.

Please provide data specific to Texas City, TX, or use a nearby location's data as an estimation.",17%

"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Texas City, TX within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities provided for each day and sum them up. However, Texas City, TX is not explicitly listed in the provided data. The closest relevant locations are Galveston, TX, and High Island, TX.

Given that Texas City is geographically between Galveston and High Island, we can use the probabilities from these two locations to estimate the cumulative probability for Texas City.

For Galveston, TX (34-kt winds):
- Day 1: 0
- Day 2: 0
- Day 3: 1
- Day 4: 10
- Day 5: 29

Cumulative probability for Galveston, TX = 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 29 = 40

For High Island, TX (34-kt winds):
- Day 1: 0
- Day 0
- Day 2: 0
- Day 3: 1
- Day 4: 13
- Day 5: 32

Cumulative Probability High Island, TX = 0 + 0 + 1 + 13 + 32 = 46

To estimate the cumulative probability for Texas City, we can average the probabilities from Galveston and High Island:

Estimated Cumulative Probability for Texas City, TX = (40 + 46) / 2 = 43
