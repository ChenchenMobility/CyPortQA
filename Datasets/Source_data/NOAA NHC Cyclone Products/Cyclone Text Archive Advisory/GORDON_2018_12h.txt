DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gordon was
located near latitude 28.9 North, longitude 87.3 West.  Gordon is
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue until landfall occurs tonight along
the north-central Gulf coast. A northwestward motion with some
decrease in forward speed is expected after landfall, with a gradual
turn toward the north-northwest and north forecast to occur on
Friday. On the forecast track, the center of Gordon will move across
the northern Gulf of Mexico today, and will approach the north-
central Gulf Coast within the hurricane warning area late this
afternoon or evening, and move inland over the lower Mississippi
Valley tonight and early Wednesday.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Unit reconnaissance aircraft
indicate that maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some strengthening is expected later today, and
Gordon is forecast to be a hurricane when it makes landfall along
the north-central Gulf Coast.  Rapid weakening is forecast after
Gordon moves inland.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.

The minimum central pressure is estimated to be 1001 mb (29.56
inches) based on recent reconnaissance aircraft data.


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Shell Beach to Dauphin Island...3 to 5 ft.
Navarre Florida to Dauphin Island, including Mobile Bay...2 to 4 ft.
Shell Beach to the Mouth of Mississippi River...2 to 4 ft.
Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Louisiana-Texas border...1 to
2 ft.

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area,
please see products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Gordon is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 8 inches over the western Florida Panhandle, southwest Alabama,
southern and central Mississippi, northeastern Louisiana, and
southern Arkansas, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches
through late Thursday. This rainfall will cause flash flooding
across portions of these areas.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin this
afternoon within portions of the warning area, with hurricane
conditions expected by this evening in the hurricane warning
area.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible this afternoon through
tonight near the coasts of Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida
Panhandle.
