"The image shows a hurricane track map from Tropical Storm Mindy, indicating its projected path and wind speed probability distribution. The storm is currently located near latitude 29.0 North, longitude 86.3 West, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). It is expected to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle later tonight, and then move offshore of the southeastern United States into the western Atlantic Ocean by tomorrow. Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches). Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 inches across the Florida Panhandle into southern portions of Georgia and South Carolina through Thursday morning is expected. A few isolated tornadoes are possible over portions of the Florida Panhandle this evening into tomorrow morning. The next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT and the next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT will be issued. The storm's freight recovery may take several days, depending on the extent of damage from the hurricane.",None

"Based on the image provided, we cannot determine the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Port of Charleston, SC over the entire event, as there is no information about the specific impact of Tropical Storm Mindy on the port's operations. The image displays a tropical storm watch map with wind speeds and probability zones for a 5-day period, but it does not provide any data related to the impact of the storm on commercial vessel activity at the Port of Charleston. To estimate the impacted number of vessels, one would need more detailed information about the port's operations, the storm's expected impact on maritime traffic, and how that would affect the port's daily average of 11.00365075 commercial vessels.",A.
