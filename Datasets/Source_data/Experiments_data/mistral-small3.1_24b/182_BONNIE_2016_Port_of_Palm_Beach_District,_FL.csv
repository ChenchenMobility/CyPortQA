"Unfortunately, the provided information does not include data for the Port of Palm Beach District, FL. Therefore, I cannot determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for that specific location based on the given table.",D.
"The table does not include the Port of Palm Beach District, FL, so we need to use a nearby location with available data. Charleston, SC, is the closest location with detailed data in the table. Since the Port of Palm Beach District, FL, is not listed, we will use Charleston, SC, as a proxy to infer the likely highest wind probability interval.

From the data for Charleston, SC:

- 0-12 hours: 22% (22)
- 12-24 hours: 10% (33)
- 24-48 hours: 6% (39)
- 48 hours or more: 1% (40)

The highest 34-kt wind probability for Charleston, SC, is in the 0-12 hours interval.
