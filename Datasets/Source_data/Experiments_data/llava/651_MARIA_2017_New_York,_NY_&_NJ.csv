"The image shows a map with Hurricane Matthew's current position labeled as '32.4N, 77.6W'. This is the location of the eye of the tropical cyclone according to the National Hurricane Center Track Forecast Cone.","14.7N, 60.1W"
"The image provided does not show a tropical cyclone with an eye or landfalling in Cuba. It appears to be a map tracking the path of a storm system over time, with various markers and graphics superimposed on it. This type of image is typically used by meteorologists and weather forecasters to communicate the track and intensity of tropical cyclones.

Without visualizing the exact state of a cyclone in the image provided, I cannot confidently determine the current position or location of the eye of the tropical cyclone. The coordinates you would look for are typically those where the storm is most intense and has a recognizable appearance on satellite imagery.

For accurate information on the current status and path of a tropical cyclone, it is best to consult official sources like the National Hurricane Center or other trusted meteorological services.","14.2N, 58.4W"

Therefore, the expected landfall location if the CT continues at the current speed and direction would be 'Leeward Islands'.",Central and northern Lesser Antilles (Leeward Islands) during the next 24–48 h

"The next intermediate advisory is at 200 AM AST, and the next complete advisory is at 500 AM AST. So, the first advisory after the current one will be at 500 AM AST. If you are looking to know when New York, NY & NJ most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions, I would need more information about the specific location within New York, NY & NJ and its proximity to the hurricane's path. However, based on the current advisory, Hurricane Maria is expected to approach the Leeward Islands Monday or Monday night. Therefore, if New York, NY & NJ are located in the northeastern part of the United States, it might take about 10-24 hours after the hurricane reaches the Leeward Islands for the tropical storm conditions to reach New York, NY & NJ. Keep in mind that this is an estimate and the actual time may vary depending on the storm's track and intensity.",48
