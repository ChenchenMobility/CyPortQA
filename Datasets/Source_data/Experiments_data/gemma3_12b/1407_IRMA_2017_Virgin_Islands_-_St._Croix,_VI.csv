"This question cannot be answered with the provided text. The text focuses on hurricane Irma's trajectory, warnings, and potential hazards, but it doesn't mention the number of commercial vessels at St. Croix or provide any data to estimate that number.



Therefore, the answer is **A. None**",C.

So, the closest number of vessels are around 20.

"The provided text doesn's give any indication of the number of commercial vessels impacted. It focuses on weather conditions, rainfall predictions, and potential hazards. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the number of impacted vessels based on this information.

Since I *must* choose an answer, and without any basis, I'll select **A. None**. This is purely a guess, as the text provides no relevant data.",C.
A. None,C.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Reasoning:**

The advisory explicitly mentions ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"" which would impact commercial vessels. The passage states ""Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area in the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions beginning tonight."" This indicates significant disruption, likely forcing vessels to seek shelter or delay operations. Given the warning area encompasses St. Croix and the potential for significant disruption, a large number of vessels are likely impacted, going beyond the average daily number.",C.
