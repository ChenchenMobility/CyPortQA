"Based on the provided information, the port of Miami, Florida, is expected to be affected by Tropical Depression Eta. The system is forecast to approach the Florida Keys or south Florida Sunday night and Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late Sunday.

Given the expected impacts and the typical recovery time for ports after a tropical storm, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations may take approximately 3 days to recover fully. This estimate considers the time needed for assessments, repairs, and the resumption of normal operations.
