Based on this information, the current location of the tropical cyclone's eye is at the coordinates '32.4N, 77.6W', which indicates that it is in the southeastern region of the United States. This is consistent with the National Hurricane Center's designation for this storm as a Category 1 hurricane. It is important to note that tropical cyclones are highly dynamic systems and their location and intensity can change rapidly, so it is essential to stay informed through official sources like the National Weather Service and local media outlets.","19.2N, 86.9W"
