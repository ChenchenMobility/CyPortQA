You are ChatGPT o3 acting as an impartial grader.

• Load the attached JSON file. Each object contains id, Question_Text, Answer_Ground_Truth, and one or more keys named Answer_LLM1, Answer_LLM2, …
• For every Answer_LLM* field (even if its value is null or empty):
  – Compare the LLM response to Answer_Ground_Truth using the rubric below.
  – Apply the hallucination rule.

# Task
Evaluate every LLM response against the Ground Truth.

## Rubric  (0 – 1, higher = better)
1.0 – Perfect  
      • Identifies the **closest official weather‑forecast point** to the port (name or coordinates match).  
      • Describes **all additional / non‑primary hazards** in the ground truth (e.g., fog, lightning, extreme heat, ice, tsunami, volcanic ash).  
      • Provides relevant **exposure context** (why the port is affected).  
      • No contradictions or invented facts.  
0.8 – Minor issues  
      • Closest location correct but omits a minor descriptor (e.g., misspells station code) **OR** lists all hazards but gives a light exposure summary.  
      • Still no clear errors or hallucinations.  
0.6 – Partially correct  
      • Gives a nearby (but not the closest) forecast location **OR** misses one significant additional hazard.  
      • Exposure context is brief or somewhat vague, but overall idea is relevant.  
0.4 – Mostly incorrect / thin  
      • Names a distant location or generic “nearest weather station”.  
      • Mentions only 1 hazard or speaks generically (“bad weather possible”).  
      • Little or no exposure explanation.  
0.2 – Barely related  
      • Talks about weather or ports but does not answer closest‑location or hazard questions meaningfully.  
0.0 – Off‑topic / wrong  
      • Missing answer, or contradicts ground truth, invents storm details, or is nonsensical.



## Hallucination rule
Hallucination rule → if invented data appears: set hallucinated=true and score=0.0 (or 0.2 if trivial).

## OUTPUT FORMAT (MUST-FOLLOW)
• Produce one minified JSON object per line (JSON-Lines).
• No code fences, no surrounding array, no back-ticks.
• No pretty-printing, no extra spaces: use canonical JSON like {"a":1,"b":2}.
• End each object with a single newline and nothing else.

## Output
Return one JSON line per input object.
Each line must contain:

id – integer from input

results – object whose keys are the Answer_LLM* field names; each value is an object with:
   * score (float, two decimals)
   * hallucinated (true/false)

Do not include explanations.

Example line:
{"id": 15,"results": {"Answer_LLM1": {"score": 0.78, "hallucinated": false},"Answer_LLM2": {"score": 0.00, "hallucinated": false},"Answer_LLM3": {"score": 0.00, "hallucinated": true},  ...}}
(You may now begin.)
