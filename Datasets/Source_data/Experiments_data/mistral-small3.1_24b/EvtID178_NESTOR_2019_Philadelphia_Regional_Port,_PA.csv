"The image provided is a wind probability table that lists various locations and the probabilities of 34-kt winds occurring within specified time frames (0 hours, 0-24 hours, 24-48 hours, etc.). Philadelphia Regional Port, PA, is not listed in the provided table. However, based on the structure of the table, we can infer that the probabilities of 34-kt winds at Philadelphia Regional Port, PA, would follow a similar pattern.

Since Philadelphia Regional Port, PA, is not listed, we can assume that the probability of 34-kt winds rising above zero would follow a typical pattern seen in the table. Most locations in the table have their first non-zero probability within the 0-24 hours time frame.

Therefore, the first time the probability of 34-kt winds at Philadelphia Regional Port, PA, rises above zero is likely to be within the 0-24 hours time frame.

**Answer: B**",A.
"Based on the provided data, Philadelphia Regional Port, PA is not listed. Therefore, the probability of 34-kt winds at Philadelphia Regional Port, PA remains at zero throughout the forecast period.

Since the question asks for the first time the probability rises above zero and Philadelphia Regional Port, PA is not included in the data, the answer is:

D. 48 hours or more",C.
"Unfortunately, Philadelphia Regional Port, PA is not included in the provided data. Therefore, I cannot determine the first time the probability of 34-kt winds rises above zero for that location based on the given information.",D.
"Unfortunately, Philadelphia Regional Port, PA is not included in the data provided. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the given information.",D.

Increased risk of rip currents,"Minor river or urban ponding, possible brief logistical delays to truck/rail transfer operations"
Flooding,Minimal; any tornado threat should remain well south of the port.
Flooding,Brief river current increases and rough seas on approach channels may prompt temporary pilotage or vessel-speed restrictions
Possible tornadoes and rough seas.,Brief reduction in visibility due to heavy showers; minor river-and-tidal fluctuations but no significant surge or wave action expected.
