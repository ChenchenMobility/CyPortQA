Tornadoes are a potential hazard.,A few tornadoes possible Wednesday afternoon through Wednesday night in coastal Mississippi and Alabama
Tornadoes.,Risk of a few tornadoes Wednesday and Wednesday night
"Potential hazards include tornadoes, coastal flooding, and hazardous marine conditions.","Brief tornadoes/waterspouts are possible Wednesday and Wednesday night; seas and swells will become rough, hampering vessel movements."
"Potential hazards include disruption of maritime traffic, coastal erosion, and damage to port infrastructure.","Very rough seas and dangerous surf, possible tornadoes in outer rainbands, and rapid river rises could disrupt port operations and ground transportation."
Minor river flooding is possible.,Brief tornadoes in outer rainbands and short-notice squalls could disrupt cargo operations.
Heavy rainfall may cause inland flooding and debris flow.,"Coastal flooding, hazardous seas, and possible port approach channel shoaling due to wave action."
Potential hazards include navigational hazards from debris and disrupted shipping schedules.,Rough seas and high waves in Pascagoula Channel; brief tornado threat in outer rain bands; possible port closures and navigation restrictions.
Navigation hazards may arise from debris and altered channel depths.,Brief tornadoes in outer rain-bands and short-fuse squalls could disrupt cargo handling and vessel movements

**Explanation:**

The forecast discussion indicates potential for significant rainfall and impacts across the central U.S. Gulf Coast, including Pascagoula, MS. Given the potential for severe weather and the fact that Pascagoula is a working port, it's reasonable to expect disruptions and a higher-than-average number of vessels impacted (delayed, rerouted, or seeking shelter). A total of 6 vessels could be impacted.",A.
