"A weather-related question!

According to the output, there is no specific forecast for New York, NY & NJ. The text appears to be a summary of various forecasts for different locations and times.

However, if you're looking for a general idea of the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival in the Northeast United States within the next 5 days, I can provide some context:

The National Weather Service (NWS) issues marine weather forecasts for the Atlantic Coast. For example, the NWS forecast for the North Atlantic Ocean (off the coast of New York and New Jersey) might include a section on ""Wind probabilities"" or ""Gust probabilities.""

Typically, these forecasts are issued every 6 hours (e.g., 0000 UTC, 0600 UTC, etc.) and cover a specific area (e.g., 30°-40°N latitude, 70°-80°W longitude). The probability values are usually presented as percentages or fractions.

For the sake of example, let's assume that the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival in the North Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New York and New Jersey within the next 5 days is around 40% to 50%. However, please note that this is a hypothetical value and may not reflect the actual forecast.

To get the most up-to-date and accurate information, I recommend checking the National Weather Service (NWS) website or contacting your local weather service office for specific forecasts and guidance.",9%
