However, based on the formatting and the presence of a ""FORECASTER CANGIALOSI,"" and NN NNN at the end, it appears this might be an excerpt from a weather forecast. Without the full forecast, a reasonable guess based on typical weather patterns might be that the probability would rise within 24 hours.

"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The provided text indicates that rainfall from Elsa will impact coastal Georgia from Monday through Wednesday. Given the average daily vessel traffic is 15.42, and Savannah is in coastal Georgia, it is highly likely that 20 or more vessels would be impacted or delayed due to the storm, especially considering potential disruptions to port operations.",C.
,C.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

*   **Elsa's Path:** Elsa is forecast to move near or over portions of the west coast of Florida on Tuesday.
*   **Port of Savannah's Location:** The Port of Savannah, GA is significantly further north along the Atlantic coast.
*   **Impact of Tropical Storms:** Tropical storms, even those not making direct landfall, can cause disruptions to shipping lanes and port operations due to altered weather conditions (winds, waves, potential for delays).
*   **Average Vessel Traffic:** Given the relatively high average of 15.4 vessels daily, even a moderate disruption from a storm impacting the broader region could easily result in a significantly higher number of vessels seeking shelter or experiencing delays that accumulate over the event's duration. Therefore, 20 vessels or more represents a reasonable estimate for the total impacted.",C.
