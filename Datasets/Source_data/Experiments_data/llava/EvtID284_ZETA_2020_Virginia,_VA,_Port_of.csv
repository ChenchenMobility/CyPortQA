"The image shows a map with a tropical cyclone (storm) in progress. The image displays various graphics and information related to storm conditions, including track forecasts from the National Hurricane Center, which is represented by a cone that outlines the projected path of the storm over time. The eye of a tropical cyclone is the center of lowest pressure, where weather conditions are typically most severe.

Based on the available graphics and information provided in this image, it's not possible to determine the exact current coordinates of the eye of the storm with precision. Tropical cyclones can change their intensity and size rapidly, which makes tracking the precise location of the eye a challenging task. Additionally, the image seems to be a graphic representation rather than an actual satellite or radar image that would show the current state of the storm in detail.

To get accurate and up-to-date information on the position of a storm's eye, it is advisable to refer to official weather services such as the National Hurricane Center or your local meteorological service. These organizations typically provide real-time and forecasted positions and paths of tropical cyclones.","17.7N, 83.4W"
