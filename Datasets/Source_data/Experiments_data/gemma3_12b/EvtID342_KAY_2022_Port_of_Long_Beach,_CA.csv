,"Large long-period swells producing high surf, beach erosion and dangerous rip currents Friday through the weekend."
,Dangerous rip currents and very rough seas in the approaches to the port could disrupt pilot boarding and vessel scheduling late week.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are possible.,High surf and dangerous rip currents beginning late Thursday and peaking Friday–Saturday.
"Potential hazards include swells, rip currents, and disruptions to navigation.",Increased swell and dangerous rip currents along the Southern California coast beginning late week could disrupt small-craft and harbor operations.

"Based on the provided text, it's impossible to determine the total number of impacted commercial vessels at the Port of Long Beach. The text focuses on wind speed probabilities and hazard information, not vessel counts. Therefore, I cannot answer your question.

However, given the severity of the hurricane and potential for disruption, the most likely answer is **D. 20 vessels or more**.",C.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

Here's why:

*   **Kay's Strength and Proximity:** The advisory describes Hurricane Kay as a powerful storm approaching Southern California.
*   **Port Operations:** Major ports like Long Beach prioritize safety. Severe weather necessitates suspensions or significant reductions in operations.
*   **Impact on Vessel Schedules:** Disruptions of this magnitude typically lead to substantial backlogs and delays. The number of vessels would likely exceed the normal daily average to clear the backlog.",C.
,C.
"A. None



**Explanation:**

The provided text focuses on the impact of Hurricane Kay on southwestern Mexico and Baja California. It doesn't mention any anticipated impact or disruption to the Port of Long Beach, California. Therefore, the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels is zero.",C.
A. None,C.
,C.
"A. None



**Explanation:**

The provided text discusses Tropical Depression Twelve-E, which is impacting areas off the coast of Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula. It mentions potential hazards like swells and rainfall affecting those regions. However, there is **no mention whatsoever** of any impact on the Port of Long Beach, California. The hazards described are geographically distant. Therefore, the number of impacted commercial vessels is zero.",C.
