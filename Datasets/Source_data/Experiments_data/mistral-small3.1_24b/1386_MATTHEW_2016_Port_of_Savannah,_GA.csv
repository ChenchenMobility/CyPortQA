"The provided data does not include information for the Port of Savannah, GA. However, based on the structure of the data, it appears that the highest 34-kt wind probability for any location is typically indicated in the earliest time intervals if the data were available.

Since Savannah, GA, is not listed, I cannot provide a definitive answer. If you need to make an educated guess based on similar patterns in nearby locations, you might consider that high probabilities often occur in the earlier time intervals (A or B).
