Swells generated by Ana will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the coast.,Elevated rip-current risk along Maryland and Delaware beaches; lowered ceilings and visibility may disrupt flight operations at nearby airports.
Swells generated by Ana will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the coast.,Elevated waves and rip-current risk along the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic beaches could affect vessel traffic and pilot operations.
Swells generated by Ana will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the coast.,Increased rip-current risk at nearby Atlantic beaches; slight coastal flooding at high tide.
Swells generated by Ana are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.,Enhanced rip currents and minor coastal/Chesapeake Bay flooding possible during high tide cycles
Swells generated by Ana are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.,Dangerous rip currents along nearby Atlantic beaches; reduced visibility in heavy rain could disrupt vessel movements
