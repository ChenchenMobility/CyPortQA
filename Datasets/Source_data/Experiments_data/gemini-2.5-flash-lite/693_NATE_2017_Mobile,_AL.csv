"The advisory states that tropical storm conditions are expected to start in the warning area in Nicaragua early on Thursday, and spread into Honduras late Thursday. The current position of the depression is 60 miles west of San Andres Island and 170 miles south-southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Nicaragua/Honduras border. The depression is moving northwest.

Considering the movement and expected landfall, the ports listed in choices A, B, C, and D are all located much further north and east and are not in the direct path of this cyclone's immediate forecast. Therefore, none of these ports are most likely to experience gale-force winds first. However, since a choice must be made based on the information, and the cyclone is moving NW towards Central America, none of the provided US port options are relevant to the immediate forecast. Given the constraints, and the fact that this question is unanswerable with the provided options, I cannot select a valid answer. The question asks to select the MOST appropriate choice from the given options, but the options do not align with the geographical information provided in the advisory.",A.
