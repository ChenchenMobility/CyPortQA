"I'm happy to help! However, I have some bad news: there is no 50-kt wind probability forecast for Baltimore, MD in this text. The text appears to be a weather bulletin or advisory, but it does not contain specific forecasts for Baltimore, MD.

If you'd like, I can try to help you find the relevant information or provide general guidance on how to read weather bulletins. Just let me know!",N/A
"None, as Baltimore, MD is not mentioned in the forecast text.",N/A
"A weather forecast!

According to the text, there is no information about Baltimore, MD, so I can't provide an answer. The text appears to be a formatted weather forecast from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) that only includes data for various locations in Mexico and Central America, such as Cancun, Merida, Cozumel, Belize City, Isle of Pines, Cienfuegos, Grand Cayman, etc.

If you'd like to know the peak 34-kt wind probability at Baltimore, MD over the next 5 days, I suggest checking a reliable weather forecasting service or website that provides information for the Mid-Atlantic region.",3%
