"No specific additional hazards are directly associated with the storm at New Orleans, LA, beyond those already mentioned.",Dangerous rip currents along Gulf beaches; minor river rises possible in southeast Louisiana
Surf and rip current conditions are likely to cause life-threatening conditions along the coast.,Elevated seas and strong rip currents along the open Gulf beaches; minor navigation restrictions possible on lower Mississippi River due to swell
"Swells are expected to increase and reach the coast of Texas and the Gulf Coast of Mexico over the weekend, generating life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.",Dangerous rip currents and higher than normal seas across the north-central Gulf
"Swells are expected to increase and reach the coast of Texas and the Gulf coast of Mexico over the weekend, generating life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.","Elevated surf and rip-current risk along Gulf beaches may extend eastward into Louisiana early next week, but direct operational impacts at the port are minimal at this time."
