"The image shows a forecast cone map from the National Hurricane Center, which indicates the potential track and intensity of a tropical cyclone. However, I'm unable to provide the current eye of the tropical cyclone because the image does not display the eye in its current position. Tropical cyclones typically have a more defined appearance when they are mature or intensifying. The cone on the map represents the forecasted potential path of the storm, and it doesn't necessarily indicate where the current eye is located. To get the current eye's coordinates, you would need to refer to a more recent or detailed meteorological report from the National Hurricane Center or another reliable source that provides real-time updates on the cyclone's position and characteristics.","32.6N, 76.5W"

Possible debris from the storm could pose additional hazards to vessels in the harbor or approaching the port.,"Low-level swell and occasionally rough surf possible, but main rip-current risk is farther north along the Outer Banks."
