"**C. 10-20 vessels**

Here's the reasoning:

*   **Event Duration:** The advisory indicates the system will impact the area starting later today and through the weekend. Let's estimate a 36-48 hour impact period.
*   **Harbor Disruption:** A tropical storm warning and potential for strong winds and heavy rainfall will likely disrupt port operations, leading to delays and potential closures.
*   **Vessel Impact:** Given the 36-48 hour disruption and daily average of 8.42 vessels, a reasonable estimate is that 10-20 vessels will be affected over the entire event.",A.
