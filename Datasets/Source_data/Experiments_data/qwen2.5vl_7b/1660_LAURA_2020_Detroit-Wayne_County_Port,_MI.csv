Tsunami and flooding from heavy rainfall in nearby rivers could pose additional hazards.,"Isolated brief thunderstorms with lightning; low risk of embedded weak tornadoes south of the port, but not expected directly at the port"
Tsunami and flooding from heavy rainfall in nearby rivers.,"Low-end tornado potential over Ohio Valley could brush southern Michigan, but risk at the port is minimal"
Large and destructive waves along the immediate coast near and to the right of the landfall location.,"Possible brief river‐level rises on the Detroit River/Lake St. Clair system affecting barge drafts, otherwise minimal direct tropical hazards expected."
"The potential for large and destructive waves along the immediate coast near and to the right of the landfall location could impact the Detroit-Wayne County Port, MI.",Minor river/stream rises possible but significant operational hazards at the port are unlikely
Tsunami,"Minor disruption to river/Great-Lakes barge schedules possible if upstream rainfall raises Ohio River levels, but direct impacts to Detroit port operations are unlikely."
