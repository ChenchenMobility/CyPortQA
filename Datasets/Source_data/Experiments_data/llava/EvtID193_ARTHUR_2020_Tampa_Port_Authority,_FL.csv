CORRECTED TROPICAL STORM WATCH END POINT TO SURF CITY IN SUMMARY

...TROPICAL DEPRESSION FORMS OFF THE COAST OF EAST-CENTRAL FLORIDA...

A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for the North Carolina coast
from north of Surf City to Duck, including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds.

SUMMARY OF 500 PM EDT INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...28.4N 78.6W
ABOUT 125 MI...200 KM E of Melbourne FLORIDA
ABOUT 505 MI...810 KM SSW of Cape Hatteras North Carolina
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 20 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for the North Carolina coast
from north of Surf City to Duck, including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Surf City to Duck NC
* Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression One 
was located near latitude 28.4 North, longitude 78.6 West. The 
depression is moving toward the north-northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this 
motion should continue during the next day or so. After that time, a faster northeastward 
motion is expected. On the forecast track, the depression is expected to move offshore, 
but parallel to, the coast of Florida tonight, and then move near 
or east of the coast of North Carolina on Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast, and the depression is expected 
to become a tropical storm on Sunday.

The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations 
and earlier aircraft reconnaissance data is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area on Monday.
RAINFALL: The depression is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches over the central and northwest
Bahamas, and generally less than 1 inch over south Florida through tonight. 
The depression is also expected to produce total rain accumulations of 1 to 2 inches over coastal North Carolina Sunday night and Monday.

SURF: Swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of
the east coast of central and northern Florida. These swells are 
expected to spread northward during the next few days, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much
of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts. Please consult products from your local weather office.
