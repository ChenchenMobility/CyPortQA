A flood advisory has been issued for parts of southeast Louisiana due to potential heavy rainfall from the storm system.,Dangerous rip currents and elevated seas along the Gulf approaches; potential for isolated tornadoes in rainbands early next week.
None,Isolated tornadoes in outer rainbands; hazardous surf and rip currents
"The potential for damage to infrastructure from strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge could cause power outages and disruptions in water supply systems.",Brief tornadoes in outer rain bands; disruptive swells/rip currents on approaches to the Mississippi River delta
Possible additional hazard is flooding from river overflows.,Prolonged heavy rain could lead to river rises along lower Mississippi and interfere with port logistics even without direct wind or surge effects
"Flood waters could cause sewer system overflows, leading to environmental contamination and potential health risks.",Long-period swells and dangerous rip currents on Gulf beaches; elevated seas in approaches to the Lower Mississippi River channel.

Explanation: The gale force probability (34kt) is based on the given forecast for tropical storm Harvey. It suggests that there is a 0.5 probability of gale force winds (defined as wind speeds greater than or equal to 34 kt) occurring at 1000 AM CDT in the 12-hour forecast, and a 1.0 probability in the 24- to 96-hour forecasts. The probability remains constant at 1.0 for all forecast times, indicating that gale force winds are expected to occur throughout the entire forecast period.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '2%', 'in 72h': '3%', 'in 96h': '3%'}"
