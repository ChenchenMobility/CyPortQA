"Based on the provided text, there is no information about the number of commercial vessels expected to be impacted at New York, NY & NJ. The text focuses on the storm's path, hazards, and general rainfall predictions. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the number of impacted vessels.

Since I *must* choose from the options, and lacking any information to the contrary, the most reasonable assumption is that there will be some impact, but not a large number.

Therefore, the answer is **C. 10-20 vessels**.",A.
