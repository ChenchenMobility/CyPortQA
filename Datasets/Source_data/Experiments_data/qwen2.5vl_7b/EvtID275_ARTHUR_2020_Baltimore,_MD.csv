Swells generated by Arthur could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast.,Dangerous rip currents and elevated surf along the Delmarva and New Jersey beaches could disrupt harbor pilot and lightering operations
Swells generated by Arthur could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.,Enhanced rip currents and rough near-shore seas along the Maryland Atlantic beaches may disrupt pilot transfer and lightering operations.
Swells generated by Arthur could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.,High surf and rip currents along the Maryland Atlantic shoreline could disrupt pilot transfers and lightering operations.
Swells generated by the depression could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.,"Elevated seas and long-period swells could produce rough Chesapeake Bay and harbor conditions, increasing wave action on exposed berths and restricting small-craft operations."
