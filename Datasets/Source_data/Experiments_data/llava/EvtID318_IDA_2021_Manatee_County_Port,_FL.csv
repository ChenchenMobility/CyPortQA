Therefore, the most likely time for Manatee County Port, FL to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions would be around 16 hours after that time, or approximately 7:00 PM CDT (1:00 AM UTC) on August 29th. However, it's important to note that the actual time may vary based on the exact location and movement of the storm.",12
"The advisory predicts that tropical storm conditions will begin in the area by late tonight or early Sunday morning. Therefore, Manatee County Port, FL is most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions at 10:00 PM CDT on August 28, which is 4 hours after the issuance of the advisory.",24

"The image you've provided shows a forecast track for Hurricane Ida, with the location of Manatee County port, FL highlighted on the map. Based on the information in the image, we can calculate that Manatee County Port, FL is most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions between 6 and 9 hours after the issuance of this advisory, which was at 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC).

To determine the exact time when Manatee County Port, FL will begin experiencing tropical storm conditions, we need more information that is not provided in the image. For example, we would need to know the specific position of the center of Hurricane Ida relative to the port, as well as the speed and direction at which the storm is moving. This information would allow us to accurately calculate the time when tropical storm conditions will reach Manatee County Port, FL.

It's important to note that forecasts are subject to change based on new data and analysis from meteorologists, so it's always best to monitor local weather forecasts for updates on the storm's track and intensity.",48
