"The image shows a weather map and a chart of wind speed probabilities for various locations in the United States. The specific location of interest is Port of Pascagoula, MS. According to the image, the peak impact magnitude at Port of Pascagoula, MS, would be 15 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). This scale is used by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to categorize tropical cyclones by their potential damage. Category 4 and higher on the SSHWS are considered major hurricanes, while Category 1 and lower are considered tropical storms or depressions. The number 15 indicates a more severe storm, with sustained winds of at least 73 mph (118 km/h).",None
