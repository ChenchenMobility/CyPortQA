"This is a difficult question to answer definitively without more information. The data presented is a very long and complex weather forecast for numerous locations, and there's no straightforward numerical value or calculation that leads to the required answer.

Here's a breakdown of why it's so hard and what we *might* be able to infer:

* **Data Type:** The text provides weather forecasts, including wind speeds, but not probabilities of arrival. Weather forecasts are probabilistic to some degree but are not directly stated this way.
* **""Arrival"" Definition:**  The prompt asks about ""arrival"" at a location. ""Arrival"" is not well-defined.  Does it mean wind? An event?
* **Complex Location System:** The vast number of locations, spanning continents, makes generalization nearly impossible.
* **Lack of Specificity:** The prompt requests the cumulative probability over 2 days.
* **Missing Detail:** The data seems incomplete for some locations. There are many ""X"" values, which indicates data is not available.

**Therefore, the answer is that, based purely on this text, there is NO answer to the question.**

**What would be needed to answer?**

1. **Clear Definition of ""Arrival"":** What specific weather event are we concerned with at Pascagoula?  For example, ""the probability of wind gusts over 25 knots.""
2. **Explicit Probabilities:** The forecast needs to state probabilities directly (e.g., ""20% chance of gusts over 25 knots"").
3. **Detailed Temporal Information:** The forecast needs to provide probability information for each of the 2 days.
4. **Understanding Data Interpretation:** Even with those details, understanding the data's reliability and how the probability calculations are constructed would be crucial.",12%
