"A. None



**Reasoning:**

The provided text focuses on Eta's impact on Cuba, the Bahamas, and South Florida. It doesn't mention any specific disruptions or impacts to the Port of Charleston, SC. Therefore, the most logical answer is that no commercial vessels are predicted to be impacted.",A.
,A.
B. 1-10 vessels,A.
,A.
,A.
,A.
"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Eta's Impact Zone:** The advisory highlights potential impacts on Cuba, the Bahamas, and Florida. Charleston, SC, is in close proximity to Florida and could be impacted.
*   **Charleston's Vessel Average:** The average daily vessel count is approximately 11.
*   **Event Duration & Severity:** The advisory speaks of potential impacts for several days (Sunday and Monday). Given the potential for ""life-threatening"" conditions, some disruption to vessel traffic is likely.

Considering the proximity, potential disruption, and the multi-day event, the most reasonable answer is:

**D. 20 vessels or more**



**Please Note:** It is very difficult to give a precise number without more granular information. But given the provided information and considering vessel traffic, disruption patterns, and potential hazards, D is the most logical choice.",A.
