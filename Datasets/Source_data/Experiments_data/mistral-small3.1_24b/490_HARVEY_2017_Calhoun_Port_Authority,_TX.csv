"The forecast does not provide specific data for ""Calhoun Port Authority, TX."" However, the closest relevant locations in the forecast are ""Port O Connor"" data can be used as a proxy.

Given the highest 34-kt wind probability.

Looking at the ""Port O Connor"" data:

- 0-12 hours: 77
- 12-24 hours: 22
- 24-48 hours: 1
- 48 hours or more: 0

Based on this information, the highest probability is in the 0-12 hours interval.

A. 0-12 hours",A.
C. 24-48 hours,D.
D. 48 hours or more,D.
C. 24-48 hours,D.
"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for Calhoun Port Authority, TX, we need to find the relevant data in the provided forecast. Since Calhoun Port Authority, TX, is not explicitly listed, we will use the nearest relevant location, which is PORT O CONNOR, TX.

Let's examine the probabilities for PORT O CONNOR, TX:

- 0-12 hours: X
- 12-24 hours: 4
- 24-48 hours: 30
- 48 hours or more: 31

The highest probability is in the ""48 hours or more"" interval.

Therefore, the answer is:

D. 48 hours or more",D.
