"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

*   **Zeta's Projected Path:** Hurricane Zeta is expected to impact the Gulf Coast and then move inland, bringing potential impacts (wind, rain, storm surge) to the Mid-Atlantic region, including Baltimore.
*   **Port Disruptions:** A hurricane impacting an area can disrupt port operations, causing delays, cancellations, and rerouting of vessels.
*   **Baltimore's Vulnerability:** While Baltimore is not a direct hit, its position along the coast means it will experience some effects from Zeta.
*   **Vessel Count and Event Duration:** Given the potential for disruptions and the estimated duration of the event, it is reasonable to anticipate a significant number of vessels being affected. The prompt specifies an impact from the 'entire event'.



Based on these factors, a total exceeding 20 vessels being impacted is the most logical estimate.",A.
"B. 1-10 vessels



**Explanation:**

The wind speed probability table indicates a very low chance (X) of sustained winds of 34 knots (39 mph) or higher at Baltimore, MD during the forecast period. This suggests minimal disruption to port operations. Given the average of 14.14 vessels daily, a small number of vessels (1-10) might experience delays or altered schedules, but a large-scale impact isn't predicted.",A.
