"To answer this question, I need to locate the wind speed probabilities for Galveston, TX in the provided table. However, Galveston, TX is not listed in the table. The table includes probabilities for Veracruz MX, Frontera MX, and Merida MX.

Since Galveston, TX is not present in the provided data, I cannot determine when the probability of 34-kt winds will rise above zero for that specific location. Therefore, I cannot select an appropriate choice (A, B, C, or D) based on the given information.",A.
