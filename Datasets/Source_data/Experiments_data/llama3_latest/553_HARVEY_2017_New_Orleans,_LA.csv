Isolated tornadoes.,Dangerous rip currents and elevated seas along the Gulf approaches; potential for isolated tornadoes in rainbands early next week.
"Isolated tornadoes are possible across portions of Louisiana, including New Orleans.",Isolated tornadoes in outer rainbands; hazardous surf and rip currents
Freshwater flooding is expected in the region due to the anticipated heavy freshwater runoff from upstream areas into Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Borgne.,Brief tornadoes in outer rain bands; disruptive swells/rip currents on approaches to the Mississippi River delta
"Isolated tornadoes are possible within the Tropical Storm Watch area, including New Orleans, Louisiana, if Harvey strengthens into a tropical storm or hurricane.",Prolonged heavy rain could lead to river rises along lower Mississippi and interfere with port logistics even without direct wind or surge effects
Flooding from increased water levels in Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Borgne is possible due to the storm's impact on local tides and water levels.,Long-period swells and dangerous rip currents on Gulf beaches; elevated seas in approaches to the Lower Mississippi River channel.
