Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are possible.,High surf and dangerous rip currents along the Southern California coast beginning this weekend
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are possible.,Increased surf and dangerous rip currents along Southern California beaches Sunday–Monday.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are possible.,"Large swells may reach southern California beaches early next week, producing strong rip currents that could affect small-craft operations."
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are possible.,Long-period south-southwest swells could produce elevated surf and rip-current risk along San Diego beaches this weekend and early next week.
"Potential hazards to San Diego Unified Port include disruptions to navigation due to altered currents and wave patterns, and potential impacts on marine ecosystems from altered salinity and sediment distribution.",Long-period swells creating higher surf and dangerous rip currents along the Southern California coast beginning late week-end.

"**C. 10-20 vessels**

Here's the reasoning:

*   **The advisory mentions:** ""Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in mainland Mexico through Friday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch areas Friday night or Saturday.""
*   **San Diego's proximity:** San Diego is within the potential ""watch area.""
*   **Impact on Vessels:** The text implies disruptions to shipping and potential delays.
*   **Average Daily Vessels:** Considering the average of 2.405536964 vessels daily, a disruption causing 10-20 vessels to be affected over a few days (Friday-Saturday) is a plausible impact from a tropical storm watch/possible conditions. This aligns with the possible delays and shipping disruptions mentioned.

Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation!",B.
,B.
"B. 1-10 vessels



**Explanation:**

The provided text indicates that Lidia's rainbands are already reaching San Diego, and the overall risk to San Diego is relatively low compared to areas further south. Given the average daily vessel count of approximately 2.4 and the relatively low overall threat to San Diego, it's reasonable to estimate that between 1-10 commercial vessels would be impacted.",B.
"A. None



**Reasoning:**

The provided information discusses a potential tropical cyclone impacting the Baja California peninsula and western Mexico. San Diego Unified Port is located further north and is unlikely to experience direct impacts severe enough to disrupt commercial vessel traffic significantly. While there might be some minor delays or adjustments to schedules, a large-scale disruption leading to a substantial number of vessels being affected is not indicated in the provided text.",B.
A. None,B.
