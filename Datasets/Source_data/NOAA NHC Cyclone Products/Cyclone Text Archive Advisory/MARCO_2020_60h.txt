DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Marco was
located near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 85.4 West. Marco is
moving toward the north-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A
northwestward motion is expected on Sunday, followed by a turn
toward the northwest and west-northwest early next week. On the 
forecast track, the center of Marco will approach the east coast of 
the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico today.  The center will approach the
northeastern part of the Yucatan Peninsula by early evening and
move over the central Gulf of Mexico toward the northwestern Gulf
on Sunday and Monday followed by a track toward the northwestern 
Gulf coast Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Additional strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days
as the system approaches the Yucatan peninsula and Marco could be
near hurricane strength when it moves over the central Gulf of
Mexico Sunday night and early Monday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
eastern Yucatan coast within the warning area this afternoon
and will spread northward and westward within the warning area
tonight, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
Hurricane conditions are also possible within the hurricane watch
area by this evening.
 
RAINFALL:  Marco is expected to produce the following rainfall 
accumulations through Sunday:

Eastern portions of the Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucatan: 
3 to 6 inches, isolated maximum totals of 10 inches.  Far western
