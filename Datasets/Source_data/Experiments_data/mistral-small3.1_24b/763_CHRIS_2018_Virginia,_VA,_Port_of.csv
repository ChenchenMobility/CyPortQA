"The data provided does not include specific information for ""Virginia, VA, Port of."" However, we can look at nearby locations to estimate the time until the 34-kt wind probability peaks. For example, we can use data from Norfolk, VA, which is a nearby location.

From the data:
- Norfolk, VA, 34-kt wind probability peaks at 5 hours (10 hours total).

Thus, the number of hours remaining until the 34-kt wind probability peaks is:

"The provided data does not list a specific entry for ""Virginia, VA, Port of."" However, there are multiple locations in Virginia listed, such as Norfolk NAS, Norfolk VA, and Oceana NAS VA. If you are referring to a general area in Virginia, you might need to consider the probabilities for these nearby locations.

For example:
- Norfolk NAS has a peak 34-kt wind probability of 9.
- Norfolk VA has a peak 34-kt wind probability of 12.
- Oceana NAS VA has a peak 34-kt wind probability of 12.

If you are looking for a specific port or location not listed, please provide more details. Otherwise, you might need to consider the probabilities for the nearest listed locations.",5%
