"The provided wind speed probability table does not contain any data for ""Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI."" Therefore, it is impossible to answer the question with the given information. However, if forced to choose from the options based on a typical cyclone's trajectory and the locations listed, a storm moving from the Gulf of Mexico towards the Texas coast would generally not impact the Virgin Islands. The closest locations with significant probabilities are further west. Without specific data for the requested location, any answer would be speculative.

Given the constraint to answer with ONLY a choice, and acknowledging the lack of relevant data, I cannot provide a factually supported answer from the text.",A.

"The provided documents indicate that Hurricane Harvey is expected to make landfall on the Texas coast on Friday, August 25th, and then stall near or just inland through the weekend. The ""Tropical-Storm-Force Wind Speed Probabilities"" graphic shows that the highest probabilities of tropical-storm-force winds (greater than 70%) cover the Texas coast from roughly Port O'Connor to Galveston and extend inland. The ""Future Wind Probability Table"" shows significant probabilities (over 50%) for sustained winds of 39 mph or greater in areas like Matagorda, Port O'Connor, Rockport, and Corpus Christi extending through Monday, August 28th.

Considering the storm's expected landfall and prolonged presence, along with the probability of sustained tropical storm force winds, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight recovery would extend for several days after the initial impact. Based on the available data, a recovery period of 3 days seems appropriate, as the storm is expected to linger and cause significant disruption.
