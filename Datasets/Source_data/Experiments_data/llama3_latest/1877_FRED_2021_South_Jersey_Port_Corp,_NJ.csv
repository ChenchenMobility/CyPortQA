"The 34-kt wind probability for South Jersey Port Corp, NJ starts at 00Z SUN and ends at 00Z THU in the given table. To find out how many hours remain until the peak of the 34-kt wind probability, we need to calculate the time difference between 00Z THU and the current time.

Since we do not know the current time, we will use a rough estimate. Let's assume that it is currently 12:00 PM EDT on Monday (since the table starts at 12Z SUN). In this case, there are 36 hours remaining until 00Z THU.

To find out how many of these 36 hours remain until the peak of the 34-kt wind probability, we can look at the values in the table for South Jersey Port Corp, NJ at 12Z SUN, which is 00Z TUE. According to the table, there are 1( 3) chances of sustained winds of at least 34 kt and a cumulative probability of 3% for this time period. This means that the peak of the 34-kt wind probability will occur within the next 3 hours.

Therefore, the answer is 3 hours.",N/A
