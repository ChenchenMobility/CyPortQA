"The provided data does not include information for Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI. Therefore, based on the given data, the answer cannot be determined. However, if we were to assume the data follows a similar pattern to other locations, we would look for the first non-zero entry in the probability column for 34-kt winds.

Since the question specifically asks for when the probability rises above zero, we can infer that the first time this happens is likely within the initial timeframes provided. Given the structure of the data, the most likely answer would be:
