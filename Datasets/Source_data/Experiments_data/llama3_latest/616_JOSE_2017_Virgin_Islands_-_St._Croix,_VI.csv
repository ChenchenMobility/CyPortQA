Significant beach erosion is expected due to the prolonged exposure of the coastline to high surf and strong currents caused by Jose's passing.,High surf and rip currents that could hamper small-craft and barge operations in open and exposed waters.
Island-wide power outages and disruptions to essential services are likely due to strong gusts and flooding.,Dangerous surf and rip currents likely to develop along north- and east-facing beaches.
"Isolated tornadoes could become a hazard in the affected area, particularly on the island of St. Croix.",Dangerous surf and rip currents beginning late Friday
"Isolated power outages, property damage, and disruptions to daily activities are expected as strong tropical cyclone-force winds could affect the Virgin Islands, particularly St. Croix.","Large, long-period swells producing high surf and rip currents beginning Saturday."
Port operations disruptions due to rough seas and increased swells may impact shipping and marine activities in the vicinity of St. Croix.,Rough seas and higher than normal surf beginning late Saturday and persisting through Sunday.
Isaac,Increasing swells and rough seas in the Atlantic exposures late weekend could hamper port operations.
