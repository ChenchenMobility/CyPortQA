"Manatee County Port, FL is not explicitly listed in the provided table. However, it is located south of Tampa, FL and north of Venice, FL. Given the probabilities for nearby locations like Tampa and Venice, and considering the typical storm track, a reasonable estimation would be similar to those locations.

Let's look at the cumulative probabilities for Tampa FL and Venice FL for 34 kt winds:
- Tampa FL: X( 4)
- Venice FL: X( 4)

The ""X"" indicates probabilities less than 1 percent. The parenthetical number represents the cumulative probability.

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days is closest to 4%.
