A few tornadoes are possible in eastern North Carolina today.,"Inland flooding upstream along the Susquehanna and Potomac basins could lead to high river flows in the Bay later next week, affecting barge traffic and reducing bridge clearances."
A few tornadoes are possible.,High waves and dangerous rip currents on Chesapeake Bay; potential river‐flood rises on the Susquehanna and Patapsco due to upstream rainfall.
A few tornadoes are possible.,Elevated seas and long-period swells could disrupt vessel approaches and create dangerous rip currents along Maryland beaches.
A few tornadoes are possible.,Fresh-water river flooding and saturated ground that could hinder cargo handling and landside access.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Fresh-water flooding may impede truck/rail access to the marine terminals; reduced visibility and debris on channels from runoff could disrupt vessel movements.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Freshwater river flooding and prolonged port-side disruptions from heavy rain and gusty winds.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Fresh-water flooding of rivers feeding Chesapeake Bay; extended periods of elevated seas disrupting vessel movements and cargo handling
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,River/creek flooding and possible debris flow could disrupt landside transport to the port
Surf and rip current conditions.,"Elevated waves and dangerous rip currents in Chesapeake Bay, possible river flooding impacting port logistics."
Surf and rip current conditions.,Dangerous surf and rip currents expected along the Maryland beaches well ahead of the storm.
