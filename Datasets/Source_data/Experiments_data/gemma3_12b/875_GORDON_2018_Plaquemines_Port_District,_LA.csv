,Dangerous rip currents and a low tornado risk in squalls.
,Dangerous seas/waves in approaches and lower Mississippi River passes; isolated tornadoes in rain bands
,Isolated tornadoes and dangerous marine/river currents likely during closest approach.
Large waves are possible.,Rough seas and elevated wave action may disrupt vessel traffic and cargo operations.
Flash flooding.,Rough seas and dangerous rip currents will hamper vessel operations; possible river rises and minor flooding in low-lying port facilities.

"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Explanation:**

The advisory indicates significant rainfall and potential hurricane conditions impacting the lower Mississippi Valley, including areas near Plaquemines Port District. Such conditions would likely lead to port closures or significant delays, impacting a large number of commercial vessels. A number exceeding 20 is a reasonable estimate given the scale of the event and typical vessel traffic.",D.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Reasoning:**

The advisory mentions significant rainfall and potential storm surge impacting Louisiana, including areas near the Plaquemines Port District. Given the mentioned rainfall amounts and potential for storm surge, it is very likely to impact vessel operations. The forecast also says that there could be impacts to the coast where vessels normally operate. While it's difficult to give an exact number, a significant event like this impacting a port with a daily average of nearly 60 vessels would almost certainly result in more than 20 vessels being affected, whether delayed, diverted, or temporarily unable to operate.",D.
D. 20 vessels or more,D.
"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Reasoning:**

The advisory discusses heavy rainfall and potential tropical storm conditions impacting the central Gulf Coast, including Louisiana. Plaquemines Port District is located in Louisiana and would be directly affected. A disruption of this magnitude would likely significantly impact vessel traffic, with a large percentage potentially delaying or cancelling their visits to the port. Given the average daily vessel count of 58.42409492, a substantial disruption would easily result in 20 or more vessels being impacted.",D.
