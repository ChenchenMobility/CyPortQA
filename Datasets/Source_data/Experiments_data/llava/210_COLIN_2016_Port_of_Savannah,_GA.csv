"The image you provided appears to be a weather forecast or a graphical representation of a weather model's output. It shows various meteorological data such as wind speed, temperature, and precipitation for different locations along the east coast of Florida in the United States.

However, I am unable to provide information on wind probability peaks at Port of Savannah, GA within the next 5 days since the image does not contain a time series or a specific forecast for that location. To answer your question, I would need more context such as the date and time frame you are interested in, the source of the forecast (e.g., National Weather Service), and the specific criteria used to define a ""peak"" in wind probability.

If you can provide this information or refine your question, I'd be happy to assist you further.",9
