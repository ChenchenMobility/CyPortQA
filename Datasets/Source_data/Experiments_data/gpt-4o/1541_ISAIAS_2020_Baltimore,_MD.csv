"Tornadoes are possible in Baltimore, MD.",Brief tornado threat Tuesday; dangerous rip currents on Chesapeake tributaries; possible short-notice channel restrictions due to debris and elevated currents.
Tornadoes,Isolated tornado risk and dangerous surf/rip currents ahead of and during passage
"The potential for tornadoes could be a hazard associated with the storm in Baltimore, MD.",Isolated tornadoes possible in outer rain bands; dangerous marine conditions on the Chesapeake Bay and approaches.
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,"Dangerous marine conditions on Chesapeake Bay (high waves, strong currents), possible short-fused tornadoes in rain bands, and port operation disruptions due to high water levels and winds."
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,"Dangerous rip currents along nearby Atlantic beaches, minor coastal flooding, and logistical delays to vessel traffic in Chesapeake approaches"
Surf and rip current conditions.,"Isolated tornadoes in rainbands, hazardous seas in approaches to Chesapeake Bay"
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Isolated tornadoes in outer rain bands; hazardous seas for shipping on approaches to the Chesapeake
Surf and rip current conditions.,Brief tornadoes or waterspouts cannot be ruled out in outer rain-bands; heavy rain could reduce visibility and hamper cargo handling.
Hazards may include life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,High waves and dangerous rip currents along Chesapeake approaches; brief tornadic squalls cannot be ruled out
"Baltimore, MD, may experience hazardous surf and rip current conditions.",Minor coastal flooding and rip-current risk possible along the Mid-Atlantic beaches; operational delays mainly driven by precautionary port measures rather than direct storm impacts.
