"The image shows that the time stamp on the Hurricane Advisory from National Hurricane Center indicates it was issued at 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC). To determine when Wilmington, NC is most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions, we need to consider the speed of the hurricane and its trajectory. Since the advisory indicates that the center of Hurricane Dorian will move near or over the coast of South Carolina and North Carolina Thursday through Friday morning, we can estimate that it would take about 12 hours for the hurricane to reach Wilmington from the time of the advisory.

Therefore, the most likely time for tropical storm conditions to begin in Wilmington is around 8 AM EDT on Friday (0100 UTC). However, this estimation assumes that the hurricane does not change its trajectory significantly and continues to move at a steady speed in the direction it is currently moving. It's important to note that these are rough estimates and actual conditions may vary depending on the evolving nature of the storm.",42

- In the next 24 hours, there is a significant chance of gale force winds developing over the coastal Carolinas as Dorian moves inland.
- Beyond 24 hours, it becomes increasingly unlikely that gale force winds will be present in the 34kt forecast range due to the expected weakening and inland movement of Dorian.","{'in 12h': '2%', 'in 24h': '6%', 'in 48h': '79%', 'in 72h': '84%', 'in 96h': '84%'}"
