"Based on the provided data, there is no information about wind speeds at Port Everglades. The data includes a wide range of locations, but not Port Everglades. Therefore, it's impossible to determine when the probability of 34-kt winds rises above zero. 

However, given the nature of the question and the constraints, the most logical answer is:

**D. 48 hours or more**

This is because the data is a forecast, and if the location isn't specifically mentioned early on, it's likely a later development in the forecast.",A.

**Explanation:**

The provided text highlights several hazards associated with Tropical Storm Eta:

*   **Heavy Rainfall:** Significant rainfall is predicted for the central and southern Florida peninsula, including the area around Port Everglades. This could disrupt port operations and delay vessel arrivals/departures.
*   **Wind:** Gusty conditions are mentioned, which could also affect vessel handling and safety.
*   **Surf/Rip Currents:** Dangerous surf and rip currents are forecast, potentially impacting coastal access and requiring vessel delays.
*   **Overall Disruption:** The text implies a significant disruption to normal operations, sufficient to impact a substantial number of vessels.

Given these factors, it's reasonable to assume that the storm would affect a large number of vessels at Port Everglades. Since the average daily number is around 12, it's likely that the impact would be greater than that, leading to the conclusion that 20 or more vessels could be affected.",C.
