DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nestor was
estimated near latitude 28.8 North, longitude 86.3 West. Nestor is
moving toward the northeast near 20 mph (32 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through today. A turn toward the
east-northeast is expected to occur Sunday. On the forecast track,
the center of Nestor will move inland over the Florida Panhandle
this morning, and will then move across portions of the southeastern
United States later today and Sunday while it becomes a
post-tropical cyclone. Nestor is expected to move offshore of the
coast of North Carolina into the western Atlantic by late Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is possible tonight before Nestor reaches
the coast. Nestor is forecast to weaken after it moves inland, and
it is expected to lose tropical characteristics and become
post-tropical on Saturday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Indian Pass FL to Chassahowitzka FL...3 to 5 ft
Chassahowitzka to Clearwater Beach FL...2 to 4 ft
Tampa Bay...1 to 3 ft

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to reach the coast
within the warning area within the next few hours, and continue
through this afternoon.

Gale-force winds are likely along portions of the Atlantic coast
of the southeastern United States later today.

RAINFALL: Nestor is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches this weekend from the central Gulf
Coast and northern and central Florida to the eastern Carolinas,
with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches.

TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible through this morning
across the northern and central Florida Peninsula.
