"Tornadoes are possible today and overnight over parts of the lower to middle Texas coastal plain, near Port Arthur.",Dangerous surf and rip currents; isolated short-lived tornadoes in outer rain-bands cannot be ruled out.
Rip current hazards are expected to occur along the Texas coast due to Hanna's swells impacting the region's beaches.,High surf and dangerous rip currents along the upper Texas coast
Flooding is expected in low-lying areas and poor drainage neighborhoods due to Hanna's heavy rain potential and rapid stream rises.,Dangerous rip currents and elevated wave action that could affect port operations and vessel handling.
Isolated tornadoes may be possible within the watch area along the Texas coast on Saturday or Sunday if the system strengthens enough to develop an eyewall circulation.,"Dangerous surf and rip currents along the upper Texas and southwest Louisiana coasts, periods of reduced visibility for vessel traffic"
"Tornadoes are a potential hazard in association with this system at Port Arthur, Texas.",Dangerous rip currents and elevated surf along upper Texas coast
Isolated tornadoes are possible within the watch area by late Friday.,High surf and rip currents beginning within 24â€“36 h of advisory time.

"Based on the provided data, it appears that there is no information specifically indicating the recovery time for the port's freight. However, I can estimate the impact of the storm based on the wind speed probability forecasts.

According to the Wind Probability Forecast Graphic Product, the Port O'Connor area has a 50% chance of experiencing sustained winds of at least 34 knots (39 mph) by Saturday evening. This suggests that the port may experience significant disruptions due to strong winds and potential flooding.

Without specific information on the recovery time for the port's freight, I will provide an estimate based on typical storm-related recovery times for ports in the region. Assuming a moderate impact from the storm, I would estimate the port's freight to recover within 7-10 days after the storm passes.
