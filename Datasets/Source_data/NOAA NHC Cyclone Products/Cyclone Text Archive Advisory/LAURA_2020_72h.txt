DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Laura was
located near latitude 20.5 North, longitude 78.0 West. Laura is
moving toward the west-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h), and this
general motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected over
the next couple of days.  A turn toward the northwest is forecast by
Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Laura will move
over the Caribbean Sea just offshore the southern coast of Cuba
today, and move into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and
Tuesday. Laura is then forecast to move over the central and
northwestern Gulf of Mexico Tuesday night and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is expected, and Laura is forecast to
become a hurricane by early Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Laura is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall accumulations through Tuesday:
 
Western Haiti, Jamaica, and Cuba: 4 to 8 inches, with maximum
amounts of 12 inches.
 
Cayman Islands: 2 to 4 inches, maximum amounts of 6 inches.
 
Florida Keys, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Northwest Bahamas:
1 to 2 inches.
 
Across the Greater Antilles this heavy rainfall could lead to
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, and the potential for
mudslides.
 
From late Wednesday into Friday, Laura is expected to produce
rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 15
inches across portions of the west-central U.S. Gulf Coast near the
Texas and Louisiana border north into portions of the lower
Mississippi Valley.  This rainfall could cause widespread flash and
urban flooding, small streams and tributaries to overflow their
banks, and the possibility of some minor river flooding to this
region.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread
westward within the warning area in Cuba through today.
Tropical storm conditions are expected in Little Cayman, Cayman
Brac, and the Dry Tortugas today.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible within portions of the watch area in the Florida Keys
today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Laura are affecting portions of
Hispaniola, eastern Cuba, the southeastern Bahamas and the
Turks and Caicos Islands.  These swells are expected to spread
across central and western Cuba, the central and northwestern
Bahamas, and the Florida Keys today. Please consult products
from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  An isolated tornado is possible across far southern
Florida today.
