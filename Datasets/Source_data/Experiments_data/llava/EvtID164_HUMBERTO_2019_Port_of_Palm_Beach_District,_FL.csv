"The image shows a forecast for the probability of wind speeds exceeding 50 knots (roughly 58 mph or 93 km/h) within a certain area in Florida over a five-day period, starting from the current time.

At Port of Palm Beach District, FL, the peak probability of winds reaching 50 knots occurs on day 1, at approximately 26 hours into the forecast period. This means that there are 26 hours remaining until the wind probability peaks for this location and time frame.",48

"In addition to rainfall, wind, and storm surge, the potential future storm may also result in flooding due to high tide or stormwater runoff.",Dangerous surf and rip currents likely beginning late Saturday and continuing through Monday
No,Rough seas and hazardous marine conditions in and near the port approaches
The potential future storm could cause flooding in low-lying areas due to storm tide.,"Choppy seas and dangerous rip currents are expected ahead of and during the closest approach, impacting vessel movements and berth operations."
The possibility of the storm center showing up on the cone increases the likelihood of heavy precipitation in the area.,High surf and dangerous rip currents along Palm Beach County beaches
