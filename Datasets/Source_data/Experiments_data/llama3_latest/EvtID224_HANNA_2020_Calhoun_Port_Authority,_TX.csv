"Based on the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, I estimate the expected time until landfall is... 72 hours.",12
"Based on the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, I predict that **72** hours will pass before the cyclone makes landfall.",18
"Based on the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, I analyze the data and provide an answer in hours.

Let me check the current position and projected track... Ah-ha! According to the forecast cone, the cyclone is expected to make landfall in approximately **72** hours.",30
"According to the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, I will provide an integer answer in hours.

Please provide the cyclone's current position coordinates (latitude and longitude) and the expected landfall coordinates, so I can calculate the time difference between the two points.

Hanna.,Dangerous surf/rip currents and an isolated tornado threat across the middle Texas coastal plain.
Lightning strikes are possible due to the approaching Tropical Storm Hanna.,Dangerous surf/rip currents and a brief tornado possible
"Isolated tornadoes are possible over southern Texas, including Calhoun County, as Hanna's outer rain bands interact with the unstable air mass.",Dangerous surf and rip currents; brief tornadoes in outer rainbands cannot be ruled out.
"Isolated tornadoes and isolated minor-to-moderate river flooding are possible within the watch area, primarily inland from the Texas coast.",Dangerous surf and rip currents will affect vessel approach channels; reduced visibilities in squalls can hamper navigation and cargo operations.
Isolated tornadoes are possible over the coastal areas of Texas as the tropical cyclone interacts with the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.,Dangerous surf and rip currents affecting vessel approaches and pilot operations.
"Isolated tornadoes are possible as the tropical cyclone interacts with the Texas coastline, posing a threat to the port's facilities and operations.",High surf and dangerous rip currents beginning Thursday night; possible brief power interruptions and minor coastal flooding affecting port operations.
