At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Two was
located near latitude 29.0 North, longitude 75.9 West. The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19

and Sunday as the system nears the coast in the warning area.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours, and the
depression is forecast to become a tropical storm overnight or on
Saturday.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).

southeastern North Carolina.

STORM SURGE: Storm surge inundation of 1 to 2 feet above ground
level is expected within the tropical storm warning area.
