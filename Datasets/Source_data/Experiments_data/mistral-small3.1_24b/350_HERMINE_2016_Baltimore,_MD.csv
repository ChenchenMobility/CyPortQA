Flooding,Dangerous rip currents and elevated waves along Atlantic approaches; minor coastal flooding possible at high tide.
Tornadoes,Brief spin-up tornadoes cannot be ruled out in outer rain-bands; reduced visibilities in heavy rain could disrupt pilotage and cargo handling.
Coastal flooding,Brief minor coastal flooding and dangerous rip currents along Maryland beaches; localized ponding on terminal roadways during heavier downpours
Tornadoes,Elevated seas and waves in the lower Chesapeake and approaches; possible restrictions on pilotage and small-craft operations
Tornadoes.,None significant expected for port operations at this time.
Tornadoes.,Choppy seas on Chesapeake Bay and reduced visibility from periods of heavy rain may impact vessel scheduling and cargo handling.
Possible future hazards include tornadoes,"Minor tidal departures and increased wave action possible at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, but impacts at Baltimore itself are minimal"
Tornadoes,Minor high surf and elevated waves on Chesapeake Bay shipping channels.
Tornadoes,None
