From this text, it appears that the highest 34-kt wind probability for Mobile, AL is not explicitly stated. However, I can suggest possible answers based on common forecast time intervals:

A. 0-12 hours: This interval might indicate a higher probability of strong winds due to storms or weather fronts.
B. 12-24 Hours: Similar to the previous option, this interval could also experience increased wind probabilities due to changing weather patterns.
C. 24-48 hours: At this time scale, the forecast might include more general information about weather trends and probabilities rather than specific details about wind speeds.

D. 48 hours or more: This interval is likely to provide more long-term forecasts, which often involve broader weather patterns and less detailed information about wind speeds.

Given these possibilities, I'll make an educated guess:

B. 12-24 Hours
