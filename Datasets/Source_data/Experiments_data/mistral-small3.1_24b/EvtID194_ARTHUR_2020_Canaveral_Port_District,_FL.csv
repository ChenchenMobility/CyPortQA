"Since the provided data does not include specific information about impacts on the Canaveral Port District, FL, we need to rely on the forecasted track and timing of Tropical Storm Arthur. The storm is expected to remain well offshore the east coast of Florida and move near or just east of the coast of North Carolina on Monday, May 18, 2020. Given that the storm is moving away from the U.S. East Coast on Tuesday, May 19, 2020, and considering the typical lead time for preparing ports for tropical storms, the expected start of impact on freight at the Canavery unlikely.

However, if we were to estimate a potential impact window based on standard practices for port closures due to tropical storms, it would likely be around the time the storm is closest to the area. Therefore, the expected start of impact on freight at Canaveral Port District, FL, would be around:
