A Storm Surge Watch has also been issued for the east coast of Georgia and east coast of Florida from Altamaha Sound southward to Hallandale Beach. Ocean-going and commercial vessel activity at PortMiami, FL should monitor the progress of Nicole and pay attention to any updates or changes in guidance provided by local authorities or the National Weather Service.",Vessels that want to stay in port must obtain Captain-of-the-Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to off-load and depart at least 24 h before hazardous winds should divert to another port.
"Given that Tropical Storm Nicole is expected to make landfall along the east coast of Florida within the hurricane warning area on Wednesday night, it is advisable for ports and facilities in PortMiami, FL to be prepared for possible impacts from the storm such as high winds, heavy rainfall, and potential flooding. Operators should monitor local weather forecasts and stay updated on any necessary evacuation or safety measures taken by the local authorities.","Ports and facilities should minimize the number of vessels in port, prepare for drawbridge closures by 20:00, and ensure readiness for sustained winds within 24 hours."
"Given that Nicole is currently a subtropical storm and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane as it moves toward Florida, it is recommended that port and facility operations at PortMiami follow any operational guidance issued by local authorities, such as reducing or ceasing operations in affected areas, monitoring weather conditions and updates from the National Hurricane Center, and implementing appropriate safety measures and procedures.",Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and may continue all transfer operations while Condition WHISKEY is in effect.
"At 1000 PM EST (0300 UTC), Subtropical Storm Nicole was moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and is forecast to be at or near hurricane intensity by Wednesday or Wednesday night while it is moving near or over the northwestern Bahamas.
