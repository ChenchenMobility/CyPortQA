"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The forecast information provided indicates a significant impact on the Gulf Coast, including Port Arthur, TX. Here's why ""20 vessels or more"" is the most likely answer:

*   **Heavy Rainfall & Surge:** Port Arthur is expected to receive 4 to 20 inches of rain with isolated maximums of 20 inches. The surge is also significant. Such conditions would necessitate a significant slowdown or halt to vessel operations.
*   **Impact on Operations:** Heavy rainfall and storm surge would likely cause port closures or significant delays. This would result in a buildup of vessels either seeking shelter or unable to enter/exit the port.
*   **Comparison to Daily Average:** The average number of vessels daily at Port Arthur is 7.317614846. The text specifies that “Delta is expected to produce 4 to 20 inches of rain... over portions of the central Gulf Coast.” Considering the severity of conditions, the impact likely surpasses the average daily number of vessels.",C.
