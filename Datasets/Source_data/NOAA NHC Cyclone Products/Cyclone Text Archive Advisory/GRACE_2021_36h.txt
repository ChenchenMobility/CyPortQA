DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Grace was
located just west of the western tip of Jamaica near latitude 
18.3 North, longitude 78.6 West. Grace is moving toward the west 
near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A general westward to west-northwestward 
motion is expected for the next several days.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Grace will move away from the western coast 
of Jamaica this evening.  Grace is forecast to move near or over the
Cayman Islands late tonight and early Wednesday, and then approach
the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico late Wednesday or early Thursday.
 
Reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 
60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.  Grace is forecast to 
strengthen into a hurricane on Wednesday, with some additional 
strengthening possible prior to the center reaching the Yucatan 
Peninsula.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.  A sustained wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a gust 
to 52 mph (83 km/h) was recently reported at Kingston, Jamaica.
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue over
portions of Jamaica through early tonight.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected along a portion of the southern coast of 
Cuba within the warning area through early tonight, and over the 
Cayman Islands beginning tonight and into early Wednesday. Hurricane

Tropical storm conditions are possible along the southern coast of 
Cuba within the watch area tonight and Wednesday. Hurricane 
conditions are expected within the warning area in the Yucatan 
Peninsula of Mexico on Wednesday night with tropical storm

RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:
 
Over Haiti...an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain with isolated
maximum totals of 15 inches are expected across the southern terrain
areas today.  This heavy rainfall will likely cause flash and
urban flooding, along with possible mudslides.
 
Over far southern Cuba...and additional 2 to 4 inches of rain.
Additional heavy rainfall could lead to flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides.
 
Over Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and portions of the Yucatan
Peninsula....3 to 6 inches of rain with isolated maximum totals of
10 inches are expected through Thursday.  This heavy rainfall could
lead to flash and urban flooding.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge could raise water levels as high as 1 to
3 ft above normal tide levels in portions of the Cayman Islands.
 
A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 3-5
feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast near and to
the north of where the center makes landfall in the northeastern
Yucatan Peninsula late Wednesday or early Thursday. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Grace will spread westward from Jamaica
to the Cayman Islands, the southern coast of Cuba, and the
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
