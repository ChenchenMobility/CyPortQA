"Based on the provided data, the port of Tampa is directly in the path of Tropical Storm Eta. The storm is expected to make landfall and move inland over the northern portion of the Florida peninsula on Thursday, with rapid weakening expected after landfall. However, tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from the center, and the port is within the storm surge warning area.

Given the storm's track, intensity, and the hazards affecting the land, it is reasonable to expect that the port of Tampa will experience disruptions in freight operations. Considering the time it takes for storm conditions to subside, infrastructure assessments, and restoration of services, it is estimated that the port's freight operations may take 3 days to recover.",2.0

"Based on the provided information, the port of Tampa is expected to experience tropical-storm-force winds starting around 48 hours from the advisory time (300 AM CST Tue Nov 10 2020) with a cumulative probability of 21% and peaking at 24% around 72 hours. The storm is expected to weaken starting on Thursday. Given the forecasted winds and the typical recovery time for ports after a tropical storm, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations may take approximately 3 days to recover fully. However, this is an estimation and the actual recovery time may vary based on the storm's actual impact and the port's specific conditions.

The storm is expected to move away from the region by Saturday. Therefore, considering the time for the storm to pass and the port to resume operations, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight may take 2 days to recover.",2.0
