"The cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days is not directly provided in the given data. However, based on the closest relevant data point, we can refer to the probabilities for Tampa FL and Cedar Key FL, which are geographically close to Manatee County Port, FL.

Given the closest data points:
- Tampa FL: 4
- Cedar Key FL: 4

A reasonable estimate would average these probabilities. Therefore, the cumulative probability would be:

(4 + 4) / 2 = 4

So the answer is:

- 36-48 hours: 18%
- 48-72 hours: 4%
- 72-96 hours: 0%
- 96-120 hours: 0%

"The data provided does not include specific information for Manatee County Port, FL. However, we can use the data for nearby locations to estimate the cumulative probability. The closest relevant data points are for Tampa, FL, and Cedar Key, FL.

For Tampa, FL (34-kt wind):
- Day 1: 1
- Day 2: 1
- Day 3: 2
- Day 4: 27
- Day 5: 8

Cumulative probability for Tampa, FL: 1 + 1 + 2 + 27 + 8 = 39

For Cedar Key, FL (34-kt wind):

- Day 2: 1
- Day 3: 3
- Day 4: 25
- Day 5: 13

Cumulative probability for Cedar Key, FL: 0 + 1 + 3 + 25 + 13 = 42

Given that Manatee County Port is located between Tampa and Cedar Key, a reasonable estimate for the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days would be an average of the two probabilities.

Average cumulative probability: (39 + 42) / 2 = 40.5
