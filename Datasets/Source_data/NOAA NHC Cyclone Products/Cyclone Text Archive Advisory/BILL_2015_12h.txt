DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bill was
located near latitude 27.9 North, longitude 95.7 West. Bill is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue today.  On the forecast track, the
center of Bill is expected to make landfall in the warning area
along the Texas coast later this morning and move inland over
south-central Texas this afternoon and tonight.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is likely before landfall.
Weakening is forecast after the center moves inland later today, and
Bill is expected to weaken to a tropical depression tonight.

Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Bill is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 4
to 8 inches over eastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma and 2 to 4
inches over western Arkansas and southern Missouri, with possible
isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches in eastern Texas.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to reach the coast
within the warning area in a few hours.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters.  The water could reach the following heights above ground if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Upper Texas coast...2 to 4 feet
Western Louisiana coast...1 to 2 feet

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the landfall location.  Surge-related flooding depends
on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can
vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes will be possible across portions of
eastern Texas and far western Louisiana today and tonight.
