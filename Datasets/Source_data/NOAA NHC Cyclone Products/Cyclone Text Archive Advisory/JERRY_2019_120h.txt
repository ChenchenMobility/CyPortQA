DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jerry was located
near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 62.0 West. Jerry is moving

well east-northeast of the southeastern Bahamas on Sunday and turn
northward on Monday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast overnight, but Jerry could
re-strengthen early next week.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
