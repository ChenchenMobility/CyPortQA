DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rosa was
located near latitude 26.7 North, longitude 117.0 West. Rosa is
moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue through Tuesday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Rosa will approach the central and
northern Baja California peninsula later today and then move
across the peninsula into the northern Gulf of California tonight.
Rosa's remnants are then expected to move across the Desert
Southwest on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with
higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast through tonight while
Rosa approaches and moves over the northern Baja California
peninsula.  Rosa is expected to dissipate over northwestern Mexico
or the southwestern United States by Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rosa is expected to produce the following total rainfall
accumulations through Wednesday:

Baja California and northwestern Sonora: 3 to 6 inches, isolated
10 inches.

Central and Southern Arizona: 2 to 4 inches. Isolated 6 inch totals
are possible in the mountains of Central Arizona.

Rest of the Desert Southwest, Central Rockies, and Great Basin:
1 to 2 inches, isolated 4 inches.

These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash flooding.
Dangerous debris flows and landslides are also possible in
mountainous terrain.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by later this morning.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible within the watch area by late this afternoon
or tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Rosa will affect portions of the coasts
of southwestern Mexico, most of the west coast of the Baja
California peninsula, and southern California through Tuesday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
