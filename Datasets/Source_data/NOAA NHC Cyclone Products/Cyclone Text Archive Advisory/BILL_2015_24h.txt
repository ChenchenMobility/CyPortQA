DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bill was
located near latitude 27.1 North, longitude 94.2 West.  Bill is
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue tonight and Tuesday.  On the forecast
track the center of Bill is expected to make landfall in the warning
area along the Texas coast Tuesday morning and move inland over
south-central Texas Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight strengthening is possible before landfall.  Weakening is
forecast after the center moves inland on Tuesday, and Bill is
expected to weaken to a tropical depression Tuesday night.

Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Bill is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 4
to 8 inches over eastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma and 2 to 4
inches over western Louisiana and western Arkansas, with possible
isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches in eastern Texas.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area tonight.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters.  The water could reach the following heights above ground if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Upper Texas coast...2 to 4 feet
Western Louisiana coast...1 to 2 feet

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the landfall location.  Surge-related flooding depends
on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can
vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
