"The warning area for the Texas coast includes Port O'Connor and Galveston, as indicated by the map in the advisory. Based on this information, the Houston Port Authority, TX is likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions some time after the warning area begins to experience these conditions. This suggests that it could be anywhere from a few hours to several days before Houston experiences tropical storm conditions. Therefore, the most likely number of hours for Houston to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions is 24.",10

"The image you provided shows an advisory from the National Weather Service (NWS) about Tropical Storm Bill, which is affecting the Texas coast. However, there is no explicit information about the start of impact on freight at the Houston Port Authority in the NWS advisory.

In general, when a tropical storm or hurricane makes landfall, it can cause disruptions to transportation, including ports and shipping activities. Ports may need to close temporarily due to weather conditions or to conduct safety inspections after a storm has passed. The specific impact on freight at the Houston Port Authority would depend on the severity of the storm and how well prepared the port is for such an event.

To get real-time information about the potential impacts on Houston Port Authority, it's best to follow updates from the port authority itself or through the local media and emergency management services.",6/16/2015

"48-HOUR OUTLOOK:
The storm is expected to weaken to a tropical depression tonight, and landfall is forecast in south-central Texas this afternoon and tonight. After landfall, it is expected to weaken further, and the deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the right of the landfall location. The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.",2.0
