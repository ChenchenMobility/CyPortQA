DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ana was
located near latitude 32.4 North, longitude 77.6 West. Ana is moving
toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn toward the
northwest and then back to the north at a slightly faster forward
speed is expected over the next 48 hours.  On the forecast track,
the center will be near the coasts of South and North Carolina by
Sunday morning.

Data from NOAA Doppler weather radars indicate that maximum
sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Although Ana has made the transition to a tropical storm, little
additional strengthening is forecast through today.  A gradual
weakening trend is expected to begin by tonight or Sunday morning.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center. During the past couple of hours, the Frying Pan
Shoals NOAA buoy measured a sustained wind of 41 mph (66 km/h) and
a gust to 56 mph (91 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area, and possible within the watch area, by this afternoon or
evening.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters.
The water could reach 1 to 2 ft above ground at times of high tide
in coastal areas from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina southward
through South Carolina. For information specific to your area,
please see products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Tropical Storm Ana is expected to produce rainfall
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches, with isolated amounts of 5 inches,
over eastern portions of North Carolina and South Carolina through
Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ana are affecting portions of the
southeastern U.S. coast.  These swells will likely cause life-
threatening surf and rip currents.  Please see statements issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
