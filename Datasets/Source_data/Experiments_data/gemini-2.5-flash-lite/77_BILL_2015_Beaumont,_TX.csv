No,Yes
"The question asks about Beaumont, TX. Looking at the table, Beaumont, TX is not listed. However, Port Arthur, TX is listed, and it is geographically close to Beaumont. The probability of 34-kt winds for Port Arthur, TX at ""00Z TUE TO 12Z TUE"" (0-12 hours) is 28%. This is the first time period listed where the probability is above zero.

Therefore, the first time the probability of 34-kt winds rises above zero is within the first 12 hours.

The final answer is $\boxed{A}$.",A.
