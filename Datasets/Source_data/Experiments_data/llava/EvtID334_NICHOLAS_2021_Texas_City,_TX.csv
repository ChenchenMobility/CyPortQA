"Based on the image provided, it is not possible to determine the specific conditions of the port at that time, including the availability of freight services. It is important to consider the potential impact of Tropical Storm Nicholas on transportation infrastructure and supply chain disruptions due to the storm's effects on the port, such as port closures, delays in cargo handling or shipments, and any damage sustained by the port facilities or nearby areas. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to provide an estimate of how many days are expected for the port's freight to recover without additional information on the current conditions and the extent of potential damage.",3.0
