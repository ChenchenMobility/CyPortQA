"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days, we need to locate Manatee County Port in the provided data. Since Manatee County Port is not explicitly listed, we will use the nearest relevant location, which is Tampa, FL.

From the data:
- Tampa, FL has a cumulative probability of 3 (for the first day).
- The subsequent probabilities are X (indicating no additional probability for the following days).

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Tampa, FL within the next 5 days is:

3",4%
0.00,10%
0.00,35%
"The data provided does not include specific information for Manatee County Port, FL. Therefore, I cannot calculate the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival for that location based on the given information.",47%
0.44,53%
"The data provided does not include specific information for Manatee County Port, FL. However, we can use the probabilities for nearby locations to estimate the cumulative probability.

For Tampa, FL (which is near Manatee County):
- Day 1: 0
- Day 2: 0
- Day 3: 4
- Day 4: 19
- Day 5: 19

Cumulative probability for Tampa, FL:
0 + 0 + 4 + 19 + 19 = 42

Since Manatee County Port is nearby, we can use this value as an estimate.

42",46%
0.02,41%
0,39%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days, we need to look at the relevant data for the nearest locations provided in the text. Since Manatee County Port, FL is not explicitly listed, we will use the data for the closest relevant locations: Tampa, FLORIDA, which includes the following probabilities:

- WEST-CENTRAL FLORIDA (TAMPA BAY AREA): 34-kt winds: 27 (cumulative over 5 days)
- SARASOTA: 34-kt winds: 18 (cumulative over 5 days)

Given that Manatee County is located between Tampa Bay and Sarasota, we can estimate the cumulative probability by averaging these two values.

\[
\text{Average cumulative probability} = \frac{27 + 18}{2} = 22.5}
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days is approximately:

23.

"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days, we need to look at the relevant data for the nearest listed locations, which are likely Tampa Bay and Sarasota, as Manatee County Port is not explicitly listed.

Since Manatee County Port, FL is not explicitly listed in the provided data. However, we can infer the probabilities for nearby locations such as Tampa Bay or Sarasota, FL.

For Tampa Bay:
- Day 1: 0
- Day 2: 0
- Day 3: 0
- Day 4: 0
- Day 5: 1

For Sarasota, FL:
- Day 1: 0
- Day 2: 0
- Day 3: 0
- Day 4: 0
- Day 5: 2

Given that Manatee County Port is located between Tampa Bay and Sarasota, we can estimate the cumulative probability by averaging the probabilities of these two locations.

Tampa Bay cumulative probability: 1
Sarasota cumulative probability: 2

Average cumulative probability: (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5

Since probabilities are typically expressed as percentages, we convert 1.5 to a percentage:

1.5 / 100 = 0.015

However, since the question asks for the cumulative probability as a number, we use the average cumulative probability directly:

1.5

But since probabilities are usually expressed as whole numbers or decimals representing percentages, we need to convert this to a whole number if necessary. Given the context, we can assume the question expects a whole number representing the percentage.

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days is approximately:

1",12%
0.02,<3%
0.00,2%
"To find the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days, we need to sum the probabilities for each day up to 5 days out.

From the provided data, Manatee County Port, FL is not explicitly listed. However, we can use nearby locations to estimate. Bradenton, FL, which is in Manatee County, can be used as a proxy.

Assuming the data for Bradenton, FL (which is not listed) would be similar to nearby locations like Tampa or St. Petersburg, we can estimate based on available data. Since the specific data for Bradenton is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact cumulative probability.

Given the lack of direct data for Manatee County Port, FL, we cannot provide a precise numerical answer.",4%
"The data provided does not include specific information for Manatee County Port, FL. However, it does include data for Tampa, FL, which is geographically close to Manatee County. We can use the Tampa, FL data as a proxy.

- Day 1: 0
- Day 2: 1
- Day 3: 1

- Day 5: 1

Summing these probabilities gives us:

0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

"The cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days is not explicitly provided in the data. However, based on the closest relevant data points for Bradenton and Tampa, FL, we can infer:

- Bradenton, FL (which is within Manatee County):
  - Day 1: X

- Day 5: 1

Cumulative probability over 5 days: 0 + 0 + 3 + 7 + 1 = 11
