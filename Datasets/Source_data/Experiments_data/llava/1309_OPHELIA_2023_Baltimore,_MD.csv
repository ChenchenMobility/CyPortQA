"The image depicts a tropical storm named ""Chris"" as of September 22, 2023 at 5:00 AM EDT (14:00 UTC). The storm is centered near latitude 30.5 North, longitude 75.0 West and is moving towards the north. It is expected to become a tropical storm before it reaches the coast of North Carolina, with sustained winds of around 50 mph (85 km/h) and gusts higher than that. The storm is expected to bring tropical-storm conditions to portions of the southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.

The image also includes a storm surge warning for Duck North Carolina to Chincoteague Virginia, a tropical storm warning for Cape Fear North Carolina to Fenwick Island Delaware, and a storm surge watch for Surf City to Duck North Carolina and Chesapeake Bay north of Windmill Point to Smith Point.

The image indicates that there is a high (70%) chance of the formation of a tropical storm within 48 hours and a high (70%) chance of its formation within 7 days. The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous waves. Swells generated by this system are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.",0
