"The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a weather alert from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). It shows a map of the projected path of a hurricane named ""Kay,"" along with information about its intensity, track forecast, and warnings for specific regions. This map is typically used by meteorologists and emergency management personnel to assess the potential impacts of a storm on coastal communities, such as Port of Long Beach, CA. The additional hazards associated with the possible future storm at Port of Long Beach could include things like flooding, storm surges, and infrastructure damage due to high winds and heavy rainfall.",Large long-period swells and rough seas creating hazardous harbor entrance conditions and potential berth motion delays
"The track forecast cone indicates that the future storm has the potential to bring storm conditions to the Port of Long Beach, California, which may lead to disruptions in port operations.",Large southerly swells creating hazardous surf and rip currents that could disrupt vessel movements and cargo operations at the port
"The presence of a cyclone could lead to disruptions in port operations and increased risk of accidents or delays due to high winds, rough seas, or potential closure of the port.","Large long-period swells producing high surf, beach erosion and dangerous rip currents Friday through the weekend."
"Floodwater from potential storm-related heavy rainfall can cause disruptions to transportation, businesses, and infrastructure in Long Beach.",Dangerous rip currents and very rough seas in the approaches to the port could disrupt pilot boarding and vessel scheduling late week.
Additional hazard: The storm may cause disruptions to maritime operations in the port area.,High surf and dangerous rip currents beginning late Thursday and peaking Friday–Saturday.
Floods in low-lying areas due to high tide and storm surge,Increased swell and dangerous rip currents along the Southern California coast beginning late week could disrupt small-craft and harbor operations.
"As a cyclone and port operations analyst, I can't provide information on future storms or potential impacts on specific locations like the Port of Long Beach, CA. The image you provided is related to Tropical Depression Twelve-E, which is currently moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h) and a turn to the north is expected in the next couple of days. However, as of my training data up to September 4th, 2022, there's no information about future storms or their potential impacts on specific locations like the Port of Long Beach, CA. I can only provide accurate and up-to-date information based on my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.",High surf and dangerous rip currents along Southern California beaches beginning late week.
