"*   Vessel operations at Tampa Port Authority should be suspended due to the strong probability of tropical-storm-force winds (over 50%) impacting the area, with hurricane-force winds also possible.
*   A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for Tampa Bay, indicating a danger of life-threatening inundation from rising waters, necessitating the cessation of all vessel activity.",No vessels may enter or transit the ports without the Captain of the Port’s permission; all vessel movements are prohibited and mariners are advised that ports offer no safe havens.
"* Vessels at Tampa Port Authority should anticipate tropical storm conditions to begin late Tuesday and continue into early Wednesday, with a possibility of hurricane-force winds.
* Given the Storm Surge Warning for the west coast of Florida including Tampa Bay, vessels should be prepared for potential life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the coastline.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens within these facilities; all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should make plans to depart the port and leave early to avoid bridge closures."
"* Vessel activity at Tampa Port Authority should anticipate encountering tropical-storm-force winds (39+ mph) with probabilities increasing to over 36% by Tuesday, July 6th, 2 PM EDT, and over 51% by Wednesday, July 7th, 2 AM EDT.
* Given the increasing wind probabilities and the storm's projected track towards the west coast of Florida, it is advised to review and implement hurricane preparedness plans for all port operations and vessels.","Vessels that wish to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; all vessels, including barges and pleasure craft, should prepare to depart the port or seek safe harbor, and vessels unable to off-load and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"*   **Hurricane conditions are expected, necessitating preparedness and potential suspension of operations.** With Elsa having re-gained hurricane status and expected to make landfall near Tampa Bay, port operations should be preparing for sustained winds of 74 mph or higher, which would likely lead to a suspension of all vessel activity.
*   **The port is under a Storm Surge Warning, indicating a significant risk of coastal inundation.** Port facilities and vessels should be secured to mitigate damage from potential storm surge of 3 to 5 feet in the Tampa Bay area, in addition to the direct wind impacts.",No vessels may enter or transit the ports without the Captain of the Port’s permission; all vessel movements are prohibited and mariners are advised that ports offer no safe havens.
"* Vessels at Tampa Port Authority, FL should expect tropical storm conditions, including sustained winds of 39 mph or greater, with a 79% probability by 7:59 AM EDT on July 6, 2021, and a 82% probability by 6:00 PM EDT on July 6, 2021.
* Given the probability of sustained winds reaching 58 mph (50 kt) at 31% by 6:00 PM EDT on July 6, 2021, and the potential for hurricane-force winds before landfall, port operations should initiate hurricane preparedness procedures and consider ceasing all maritime operations.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens within these facilities; all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should make plans to depart the port and leave early to avoid bridge closures."
"* Vessel activity at Tampa Port Authority, FL should exercise extreme caution as there is a 36% probability of tropical-storm-force winds by 2 AM EDT Tuesday and a 58% probability by 2 AM EDT Wednesday.
* It is recommended to review and implement hurricane preparedness plans for all vessels and port facilities due to the potential for significant wind impacts.","Vessels that wish to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; all vessels, including barges and pleasure craft, should prepare to depart the port or seek safe harbor, and vessels unable to off-load and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"Port and facility operations at Tampa Port Authority, FL should prepare for potential hurricane-force winds and storm surge. Given the Hurricane Warning for Egmont Key to the Steinhatchee River and the Storm Surge Warning for the west coast of Florida including Tampa Bay, it is advised to take all necessary actions to protect life and property.",All waterfront operations are suspended except final safety preparations approved by the Captain of the Port; facility storm preparations should already be complete.
"* **High probability of tropical storm force winds (39+ mph)** impacting Tampa Port Authority, FL, beginning on Tuesday evening and continuing into Wednesday morning, with a 70-79% chance.
* **Potential for hurricane force winds (74+ mph)** exists for Tampa Port Authority, with a 5-7% probability of sustained winds of 64+ mph, and a 31% chance of 50+ mph winds, indicating a need for preparations for significant wind impacts.","Ports and facilities should minimize the number of vessels in port, recognize that no safe havens are available, and continue to monitor Coast Guard Homeport for detailed guidance."
"*   Tampa Port Authority, FL has a 51% probability of experiencing tropical storm-force winds (39 mph or greater) within the next 120 hours, with an 18% chance of hurricane-force winds (74 mph or greater).
*   Given these probabilities, port operations should be preparing for potential impacts from Tropical Storm Elsa, including securing cargo, reviewing emergency procedures, and monitoring further advisories.",Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and cargo-transfer operations may continue while Port Condition X-RAY is in effect.
"At this time (approximately 8 PM EDT Tuesday, July 6th), Tampa Port Authority should expect tropical storm conditions to be occurring or imminent, with winds potentially reaching 39-58 mph. All vessel operations should cease or be secured, and all personnel should evacuate to safe locations due to the high probability of hazardous conditions.",No vessels may enter or transit the ports without the Captain of the Port’s permission; all vessel movements are prohibited and mariners are advised that ports offer no safe havens.
"Based on the provided graphics and advisories, Tampa Port Authority, FL has a 47% probability of experiencing tropical storm-force winds (39 mph or greater) by 2 PM EDT Saturday, July 10th. Given the current forecast track, it is highly probable that Tropical Storm Elsa will be making landfall on the west coast of Florida by late Tuesday, impacting operations at Tampa Port Authority. Therefore, general vessel activity is likely to be significantly curtailed or suspended due to expected tropical storm conditions.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens within these facilities; all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should make plans to depart the port and leave early to avoid bridge closures."
