"This is a trick question. The provided text *does not contain* any information about South Jersey Port Corp, NJ. Therefore, it's impossible to determine when the probability of 34-kt winds at that location rises above zero based on this text.

However, since you've requested only a choice from A, B, C, or D, and given the context of the data being for ""locations and time periods during the next 5 days,"" if this location *were* listed, it would likely fall within one of the provided time windows.

Since I must select a choice from the given options, and the data starts its forecast from ""18Z MON"", the earliest possible time for any probability to be above zero for a listed location is ""0 hours"" relative to the start of the forecast. This is the most logical choice to make if the question were answerable from the provided text and South Jersey Port Corp was listed at the very beginning of the forecast period.
