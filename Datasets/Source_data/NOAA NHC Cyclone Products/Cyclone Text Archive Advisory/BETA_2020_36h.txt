DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beta was
located by an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft and NOAA
Doppler weather radars near latitude 27.6 North, longitude 93.6
West. Beta is moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h),
and this general motion is forecast to continue during the next day
or so. A decrease in forward speed and a turn to the north and
northeast is expected Monday night and Tuesday. On the forecast
track, the center of Beta will continue to move toward the coast of
Texas and will likely move inland by Monday night, and remain close
to the coast of southeastern Texas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next couple
of days before Beta reaches the Texas coast. Weakening is
anticipated once Beta moves inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the
reconnaissance aircraft is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
San Luis Pass, TX to Sabine Pass, TX including Galveston Bay...3-5
ft
Port Aransas, TX to San Luis Pass, TX including Copano Bay, Aransas
Bay, San Antonio Bay, and Matagorda Bay…2-4 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA including Sabine
Lake and Calcasieu Lake…2-4 ft
Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA to Ocean Springs, MS including
Vermilion Bay, Lake Borgne, Lake Pontchartrain, and Lake
Maurepas...1-3 ft
Baffin Bay, TX to Port Aransas, TX including Corpus Christi Bay and
Baffin Bay... 1-3 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande to Baffin Bay, TX...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the tropical
storm warning area along the southwestern Louisiana coast and will
spread westward to the warning areas in Texas late today through
early Monday. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
tropical storm watch area along the south Texas coast on
Monday.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Thursday, Beta is expected to produce rainfall
accumulations of 8 to 12 inches with isolated totals of 20 inches
from the middle Texas coast to southern Louisiana, with 4 to 8
inches spreading northward into the lower Mississippi River Valley
by mid-week. Flash and urban flooding is likely, as well as minor
to isolated moderate river flooding.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two could occur Monday near the
middle-to-upper Texas coast or the southwestern Louisiana coast.
 
SURF:  Swells are increasing and reaching the coast of Texas and
the Gulf Coast of Mexico, generated by a combination of Beta and a
cold front entering the northern Gulf of Mexico.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
