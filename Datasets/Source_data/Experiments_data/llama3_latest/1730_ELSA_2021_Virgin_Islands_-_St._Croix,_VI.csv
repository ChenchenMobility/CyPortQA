Explanation: At 12 hours, the gale force probability (34kt) is ONLY 34kt. This means that at this time, there is a low probability of the winds reaching gale force (speeds of 34 knots or more). The probabilities are expected to remain low for the next 24 hours as well. However, by 48 hours, the gale force probability increases to 34kt again, indicating that there is a moderate probability of the winds reaching gale force at this time. At 72 hours, the probability remains 34kt. Finally, at 96 hours, the probability drops to 00kt, which means that at this time, there is no probability of the winds reaching gale force. This suggests that the wind speeds are expected to decrease below gale force by 96 hours.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '0%'}"

Across portions of Cuba Sunday into Monday, rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches is expected, which will result in significant flash flooding and mudslides. Swells generated by Elsa will spread westward across the Caribbean Sea through the weekend.
