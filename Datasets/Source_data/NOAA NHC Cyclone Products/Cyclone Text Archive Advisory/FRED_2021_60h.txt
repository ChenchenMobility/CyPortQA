of the lower Florida Keys this afternoon, move across the eastern 
Gulf of Mexico tonight through Monday, and move inland over the 
northern Gulf coast Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher

RAINFALL:  Tropical Depression Fred is expected to produce the
following rainfall amounts:
 
Portions of Cuba...2 to 5 inches with isolated maximum totals of 8
inches. This rainfall may lead to scattered flash flooding.
 
Across the Bahamas...1 to 3 inches, with isolated maximum totals of
5 inches.
 
Through Monday, 3 to 5 inches of rain with local amounts of 8 inches
is anticipated across the Keys and southern Florida.  Across the
Florida Big Bend and Panhandle, 3 to 7 inches with isolated maximum
totals of 10 inches are expected.  Heavy rainfall could lead to
areal, urban, and small stream flooding impacts, and cause new minor
flooding across the western Florida Peninsula and exacerbate ongoing
minor to isolated moderate flooding in northern Florida.
 
From Monday onward, heavy rain and flood impacts could extend into
inland portions of the Southeast and into the southern and central
Appalachians and Piedmont as Fred interacts with a front in the
area.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
warning area across the Florida Keys later today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fred are expected to spread across the
Florida Keys later this morning and reach the coast of Alabama
