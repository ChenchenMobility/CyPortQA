"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory highlights the imminent threat of a major hurricane impacting the middle Texas coast, including Port Freeport. The predicted storm surge and wind conditions are severe enough to warrant significant operational disruptions. Given the average daily vessel count, a disruption lasting for several days (as the advisory suggests Harvey will stall over the area through the weekend) would easily surpass 20 vessels.",D.
"A. None



**Reasoning:**

The provided text focuses on rainfall, storm surge, and wind hazards. It does not contain any information about the number of commercial vessels at Port Freeport or any predictions about their impact. Therefore, we cannot determine the impacted number of commercial vessels based on the provided text.",D.
