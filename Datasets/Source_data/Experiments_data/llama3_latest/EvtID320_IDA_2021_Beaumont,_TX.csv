No",Yes
"Based on the provided data, it appears that there is no information about the probability of 34-kt winds at Beaumont, TX. The data only includes a list of points with coordinates and a note about the forecaster (Cangialosi) but does not contain any information about wind probabilities.

According to the forecast data, there are no probabilities greater than zero for 34-knot winds at Beaumont, TX until after 48 hours (i.e., at 0-24 hours, all probabilities are zero).",A.
"The correct answer is A. 0 hours. The first line of the forecast text indicates that the probability of 34-kt winds at Beaumont, TX is already above zero, specifically at 13%.",C.
The correct answer is D. 48 hours or more.,D.
"According to the forecast data, the probability of 34-kt winds at Beaumont, TX does not rise above zero until 15 hours (0-14 hours = 0). Therefore, the correct answer is:
