DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rosa was located
near latitude 17.7 North, longitude 117.8 West. Rosa is moving
toward the northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A turn toward the north
is expected overnight, followed by a turn toward the north-northeast
with a slight increase in forward speed by early next week.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 120 mph (195 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rosa is a category 3 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional weakening is
anticipated over the next few days, and Rosa could become a
tropical storm by the end of the weekend.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Rosa will affect portions of the coasts
of southwestern Mexico, the southern Baja California Peninsula, and
southern California late this week and over the weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
