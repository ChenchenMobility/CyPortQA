Rip Currents,Low tornado threat confined to north Florida and southeast Georgia – not expected near PortMiami.
Tornadoes.,Increased rip-current risk and higher surf along the southeast Florida beaches Thursday–Friday.
Rip currents,Isolated tornado risk mainly across central–north Florida; not expected in the Miami area
Tornadoes,Isolated tornadoes or waterspouts possible in outer rain-bands; brief interruptions to port operations from heavy rain and squalls
Tornadoes are possible.,"Brief tornadoes in outer bands cannot be ruled out, and elevated seas/short-period swell could disrupt pilot transfers and container-handling operations."
Tornadoes.,Dangerous rip currents along the southeast Florida beaches and a low tornado risk in outer rain-bands.
Rip currents and rough seas,Localized street flooding and reduced visibility may disrupt port and road operations
Tornadoes,Hazardous seas and rip currents for vessels entering/exiting Government Cut; localized street flooding during peak downpours.
Rip currents,Ponding on terminal yards and roadway flooding may disrupt port truck traffic.
