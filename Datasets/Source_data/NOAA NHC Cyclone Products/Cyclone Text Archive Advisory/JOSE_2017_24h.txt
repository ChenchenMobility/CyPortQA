DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 57.1 West. Jose is moving toward
the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h).  A gradual turn toward
the northwest with a decrease in forward speed is expected during
the next 48 hours.  On the forecast track, the center of Jose will
pass near or east of the northeastern Leeward Islands on Saturday.

Recent data from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter plane indicate that
maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible
for the next day or so, and gradual weakening is expected after
that.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).

The minimum central pressure indicated by data from the aircraft is
942 mb (27.82 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch
area on Saturday, and tropical storm conditions are expected within
the tropical storm warning areas by Saturday morning. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch area in the
northeastern Leeward Islands by Saturday morning and in the watch
area in the Virgin Islands by Saturday night.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 5 inches in the Leeward Islands from Guadeloupe to Anguilla,
with isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches. Jose is also expected to
produce total rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over the Virgin
Islands and Dominica. This rainfall will maintain any ongoing
flooding and may cause additional life-threatening flooding.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are expected to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands by later today.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
