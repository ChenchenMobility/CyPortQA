"The image you provided appears to be a public advisory from the National Hurricane Center regarding the remnants of Fred in the Gulf of Mexico. However, it does not mention Wilmington, DE specifically.

"The text states that the Florida Keys and southwest coast of Florida from Bonita Beach south and east to Ocean Reef, including Florida Bay are under a Tropical Storm Watch as of 5:00 PM EDT on Thursday, August 12th. This indicates that Wilmington, DE may begin experiencing tropical storm conditions at some point after the time of the advisory.

To determine the most likely time for Wilmington, DE to experience tropical storm conditions, we need more information about the current position and movement of Tropical Depression Fred, as well as any updates to the forecast track and intensity.

Based on the current forecast track, Tropical Depression Fred is expected to move along or just north of eastern and central Cuba tonight and Friday, and be near the Florida Keys and southern Florida on Saturday. If we assume that Wilmington, DE is located approximately 12 hours due west from the center of Tropical Depression Fred (as indicated by the advisory), then we can estimate that Wilmington, DE may begin experiencing tropical storm conditions around 7:00 PM EDT on Friday, August 13th.

However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate based on the current forecast track and intensity of Tropical Depression Fred, as well as assumptions about the distance between Wilmington, DE and the center of the storm. Any changes to the forecast track or intensity may affect the timing of tropical storm conditions for Wilmington, DE.",84
