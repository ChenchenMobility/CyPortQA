River flooding and potential for debris flow are additional hazards.,Isolated tornadoes possible Wednesday as outer rainbands move inland; temporary navigation restrictions on the Mississippi River likely due to heavy rain and gusty winds.
,"Localized river rises, urban flooding, and isolated tornadoes in outer rainbands may disrupt port and ground transport operations"
,Brief tornadoes in feeder bands and possible river level rises from upstream rainfall could affect cargo handling and ground transport.
Navigation hazards may arise from reduced visibility and potential for debris in the waterways.,"Elevated river levels, debris, and possible navigation restrictions on the Mississippi River channel."

"B. 1-10 vessels



**Explanation:**

The advisory mentions potential tropical storm conditions impacting the central Gulf Coast, including areas near Baton Rouge. Given the average daily vessel count of roughly 11, a tropical storm would likely disrupt operations, but a complete shutdown is not explicitly stated. A disruption leading to 1-10 fewer vessels seems plausible.",A.
