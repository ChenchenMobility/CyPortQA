"Based on the table provided:

For Location: GFMX 290N 850W
Periods: FROM    FROM    FROM    FROM    FROM    FROM 
TIME       00Z WED 12Z WED 00Z THU 12Z THU 00Z FRI 00Z SAT 00Z SUN

For Port of Pascagoula, MS (34-kt wind probability):

* Probability for 50 kt is X at 00Z WED
* Probability for 50 kt is X at 12Z WED
* Probability for 50 kt is X at 00Z THU
* Probability for 50 kt is 1(1) at 12Z THU
* Probability for 50 kt is X at 00Z FRI
* Probability for 50 kt is X at 00Z SAT
* Probability for 50 kt is X at 00Z SUN

Since the probability peaks at 1% (1/100) at 12Z THU, it takes approximately 36 hours until the peak.
