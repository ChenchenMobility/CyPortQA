"To answer this question, I need to find the probability for Beaumont, TX. However, Beaumont, TX is not explicitly listed in the provided table. As a cyclone and port operations analyst, I would look for the closest available location or a location that would likely experience similar wind impacts based on the storm's track.

Looking at the provided table, the closest Texan locations listed that would likely be affected by a storm moving across the Gulf of Mexico and potentially inland are Port Arthur, TX, Galveston, TX, Houston, TX, and coastal locations like High Island TX and Freeport TX. Beaumont is inland from Port Arthur and Houston.

Given the options, I need to find the highest 34-kt wind probability for a location that would be a reasonable proxy for Beaumont. Let's examine the initial probabilities (0-12 hours) for these nearby locations:

*   **Port Arthur, TX:** 34-kt probability is 30% (0-12 hours), 38% (12-24 hours).
*   **Galveston, TX:** 34-kt probability is 21% (0-12 hours).
*   **Houston, TX:** 34-kt probability is 7% (0-12 hours).
*   **High Island, TX:** 34-kt probability is 31% (0-12 hours).
*   **Freeport, TX:** 34-kt probability is 9% (0-12 hours).

The question asks for the *highest* 34-kt wind probability for Beaumont, TX. Since Beaumont is inland and slightly north of Port Arthur and High Island, and given the storm's track (center near 27.6N 92.6W at 1500Z), it's likely that the probabilities would diminish as the storm moves inland.

Let's consider the probabilities for Port Arthur, TX and High Island, TX as potential indicators for Beaumont's wind impacts:

*   **Port Arthur, TX:**
    *   0-12 hours: 30%
    *   12-24 hours: 38%
    *   24-48 hours: 1%
    *   48 hours or more: X (less than 1%)
*   **High Island, TX:**
    *   0-12 hours: 31%
    *   12-24 hours: 19%
    *   24-48 hours: X (less than 1%)
    *   48 hours or more: X (less than 1%)

Comparing the highest probabilities for these proxy locations:
*   Port Arthur reaches its highest 34-kt probability (38%) in the 12-24 hour period.
*   High Island reaches its highest 34-kt probability (31%) in the 0-12 hour period.

If we assume Beaumont would experience a similar, or slightly reduced, impact from Port Arthur or High Island, the highest probability appears to be in the 12-24 hour window for Port Arthur.

Therefore, the most appropriate choice, based on the available data for nearby locations, is the time interval with the highest probability.
