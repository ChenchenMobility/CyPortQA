"The image shows a wind speed probability table for Tropical Storm Fred. The table lists probabilities of sustained winds of at least 34 kt (39 mph...63 km/h) at selected locations and time periods during the next 5 days, from 12Z Sun to 12Z Fri.

To answer your question, we need to determine when the cumulative probability for wind speeds of at least 50 kt (58 mph...93 km/h) peaks within the next 5 days at Manatee County Port, FL. Based on the table, the cumulative probability for 50 kt winds starts at 2% at 12Z Sun and increases to 18% by 12Z Fri for locations in Florida's panhandle, such as Panama City and Pensacola.

Assuming that the probabilities increase linearly between the cumulative probabilities listed (12Z Sun to 12Z Fri), we can estimate that it takes approximately 48 hours for the cumulative probability of sustained winds of at least 50 kt to reach 50% (from 2% at 12Z Sun to 50% at 12Z Fri).

Therefore, if we add 48 hours to the time frame and round up to the nearest integer for precision, approximately 50 hours remain until the 50-kt wind probability peaks at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days.",N/A

"The image you have provided appears to be an advisory from the National Hurricane Center regarding the remnants of Fred. According to this advisory, a Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for portions of the north-central Gulf coast from the Alabama/Florida border eastward to Ochlockonee River, Florida. The advisory indicates that tropical storm conditions are possible within 48 hours and mentions that a Tropical Storm Warning will likely be required for portions of the Tropical Storm Watch area later this morning.

Therefore, it can be inferred that Manatee County Port, FL is most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions sometime after the advisory was issued at 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC) on Sunday, August 15, 2021. However, without additional information or updates from the National Hurricane Center, it is not possible for me to provide a specific time or date when Manatee County Port, FL will begin experiencing tropical storm conditions based solely on this advisory.",40
