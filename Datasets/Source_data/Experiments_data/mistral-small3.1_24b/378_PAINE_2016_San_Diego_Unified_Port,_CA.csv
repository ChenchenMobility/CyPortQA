"The wind probability table does not include San Diego. As such, we will have to use the closest locations to San Diego to make an inference. The closest locations to San Diego are:

1. Ensenada
2. Is. Guadalupe
3. Punta Eugenia
4. Puerto Abreojos
5. Puerto Penasco

The highest 34-kt wind probability for these locations is in the 48-72 hours range at 3% for Ensenada. There is no probability for San Diego, so the answer must be inferred.
