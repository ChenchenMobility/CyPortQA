"A weather forecast!

According to the table, the cumulative probabilities for 34-kt wind arrival at Texas City, TX are:

* Day 1: X (not available)
* Day 2: X
* Day 3: 1%
* Day 4: 9%
* Day 5: 16%

The cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival within the next 5 days is therefore:

1% + 9% + 16% = 26%

Answer: **26**",54%
"Based on the forecast data provided, I extracted the information relevant to Texas City, TX and calculated the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival within the next 5 days.

Here's the calculation:

* For day 1: P(34-kt wind) = 0%
* For day 2: P(34-kt wind) = 4%
* For day 3: P(34-kt wind) = 10%
* For day 4: P(34-kt wind) = 15%
* For day 5: P(34-kt wind) = 20%

To calculate the cumulative probability, I added up the individual probabilities:

P(cumulative, 34-kt wind within next 5 days) = 0% + 4% + 10% + 15% + 20% = 49%

So, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Texas City, TX within the next 5 days is **49%.**",60%
