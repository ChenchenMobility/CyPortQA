"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation**

The advisory explicitly mentions ""heavy and excessive rainfall in the following areas... Southeastern coastal North Carolina into far northeastern South Carolina...an additional 20 to 25 inches, with isolated storm totals of 30 to 40 inches."" Given the severity of the storm and the impact on Charleston, SC, a total number of 20 or more vessels would be impacted.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory details catastrophic conditions, including storm surge and torrential rainfall, impacting a wide area. Given the scale of the event and the potential for port closures, it's highly probable that the Port of Charleston would experience a significant disruption, resulting in a substantial number of vessels being impacted.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Explanation:**

The advisory mentions ""life-threatening storm surge"" and ""dangerous conditions"" impacting a large area including Charleston, SC. Commercial vessels would be significantly affected and likely delayed or prevented from entering/leaving the port. Given the severity of the predicted storm, it's highly probable that significantly more than the daily average of vessels would be impacted, exceeding 20.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory explicitly mentions ""interests elsewhere in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic states should monitor the progress of Florence."" Charleston is in the southeastern region and would be impacted. Given the severity of the storm (Category 4 hurricane), the prolonged duration of impact, and the precautionary measures that would be taken, a significant disruption to port operations and a high probability of vessels seeking safe harbor outside the port are expected. Given that the average daily number of vessels is around 11, a storm of this magnitude would significantly exceed that number seeking refuge.",D.
C,D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The provided text discusses Hurricane Florence and its potential impacts. While it doesn's provide a direct count of vessels impacted, it details significant hazards:

*   **Storm Surge:** Portions of the coast, including areas near Charleston, SC, are predicted to experience substantial storm surge (4-6 feet).
*   **Rainfall:** High rainfall totals (15-20 inches with potential for more) are expected.
*   **Wind:** Hurricane conditions are likely.

Given the severity of these hazards, it's highly probable that a substantial number of commercial vessels would be affected. Given that the average daily number of vessels is just over 11, and the severity of the event, it is extremely likely that a greater than average number of vessels would be impacted.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Explanation:**

The provided text discusses Hurricane Florence's potential impact on the US East Coast. While it doesn't give a precise number of vessels impacted at Charleston, it highlights that the hurricane is expected to be ""extremely dangerous"" and will likely impact the coastline. Given the potential for significant disruption to port operations due to high winds, storm surge, and potential damage, it's reasonable to assume a substantial impact, exceeding the average daily vessel count.",D.
D. 20 vessels or more,D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The provided text indicates Florence is expected to approach the southeastern coast of the United States on Thursday, and forecasts it to be an ""extremely dangerous major hurricane."" Given the predicted intensity and proximity to Charleston, SC, it is highly probable that port operations would be suspended or significantly curtailed for a period. While the text doesn't give a precise number, the severity of the forecast suggests a substantial impact, making 20 or more vessels a reasonable estimate.",D.

,"Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Given the impending threat of Hurricane Florence and the advisory indicating it will be an extremely dangerous major hurricane approaching the southeastern coast, general vessel activity at the Port of Charleston, SC, should be suspended or significantly restricted pending further assessment and updated forecasts. Vessels should seek safe harbor, and port operations should prepare for potential closures and disruptions.","All vessels must initiate heavy-weather preparatory measures, review their storm mooring or departure plans, and maintain readiness to clear the port as conditions escalate."
"Given the Hurricane Warning and potential for life-threatening storm surge and rainfall, ocean-going and commercial vessels at the Port of Charleston should prioritize seeking safe harbor and delaying any departures until the storm has passed and conditions improve, following guidance from the U.S. Coast Guard and port authorities. They should also be aware of potentially dangerous surf and rip current conditions.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Given that Hurricane Florence is rapidly strengthening and expected to approach the southeastern U.S. coast as a major hurricane, ocean-going and commercial vessels at the Port of Charleston should prepare for potential disruptions and likely receive guidance to seek safe harbor or adjust routes to avoid hazardous conditions. They should closely monitor updated forecasts and adhere to any port-specific advisories or restrictions issued due to the storm.","All vessels must initiate heavy-weather preparatory measures, review their storm mooring or departure plans, and maintain readiness to clear the port as conditions escalate."
,"Cargo and facility operations may continue; facility operators should activate hurricane plans, secure loose equipment, and prepare to suspend operations if conditions escalate."
,"Ports and waterfront facilities remain open for normal operations; operators should secure hazardous cargo, verify emergency equipment, and begin implementing heavy-weather procedures in anticipation of conditions advancing beyond WHISKEY."
"Given the Hurricane Florence advisory and the potential for dangerous storm surge, rainfall, and winds, the Port of Charleston will likely experience operational restrictions or a temporary closure within the next 12 hours. Expect delays, limited vessel movement, and potential harbor closures to ensure safety until the storm passes and assessments can be made.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Given the hurricane watch and potential for life-threatening surf and rip currents, the Port of Charleston will likely issue restrictions on vessel activity within 24 hours, potentially including delays, suspended operations, or limitations on size and type of vessels allowed. These actions would prioritize safety and minimize risk until the storm's impact subsides.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Given that Hurricane Florence is rapidly strengthening and expected to approach the southeastern coast of the United States on Thursday, the Port of Charleston will likely implement port closures or severe restrictions on vessel activity within the next 36 hours. This would prioritize safety and minimize potential damage from high winds, storm surge, and hazardous sea conditions.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Given that Hurricane Florence is forecast to approach the southeastern coast of the United States, including Charleston, SC, within the next 12 hours, the most likely operational guidance for general vessel activity would be restrictions or a temporary suspension of operations to ensure safety. Vessels would likely be advised to seek safe harbor and port authorities would implement protocols to protect infrastructure and personnel.","All vessels must initiate heavy-weather preparatory measures, review their storm mooring or departure plans, and maintain readiness to clear the port as conditions escalate."
"Given Florence is forecast to approach the southeastern U.S. coast as an extremely dangerous major hurricane within 48 hours, the Port of Charleston will likely implement operational guidance restricting vessel activity, potentially including temporary closures or limitations on vessel size and movement, to ensure safety. This would likely involve communications from the US Coast Guard and port authorities regarding specific restrictions.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Given the imminent threat of Hurricane Florence, including potential for dangerous storm surge and high winds, ocean-going and commercial vessel activity at the Port of Charleston will likely be suspended or severely restricted within the next 12 hours, prioritizing vessel safety and port operational integrity. Expect potential anchoring outside the harbor or diversion to alternative ports as a precautionary measure.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Given the imminent threat of Hurricane Florence and its expected approach to the South Carolina coast, commercial vessel activity at the Port of Charleston will likely be suspended or significantly restricted within the next 24 hours. This would involve vessels being instructed to seek safe harbor elsewhere or remain anchored outside the port until the storm passes and conditions are deemed safe for navigation.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Given the imminent threat of Hurricane Florence and its expected impact on the southeastern U.S. coast, the most likely guidance for vessel activity at the Port of Charleston in 36 hours would be restrictions or a temporary shutdown of operations to ensure safety and prevent damage. This would likely involve suspending vessel arrivals and departures, and potentially securing cargo and infrastructure.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Given the forecast for Hurricane Florence to approach the southeastern U.S. coast as a major hurricane within 12-24 hours, commercial vessel activity at the Port of Charleston will likely be significantly curtailed or suspended. Vessels will likely seek safe harbor, and port operations will be paused to minimize risk from high winds, storm surge, and potential disruptions to navigation.","All vessels must initiate heavy-weather preparatory measures, review their storm mooring or departure plans, and maintain readiness to clear the port as conditions escalate."
"Given Florence's forecast to approach the southeastern U.S. coast as a major hurricane within 48 hours, the Port of Charleston will likely experience operational disruptions, potentially including temporary closures or restrictions on vessel traffic, to ensure safety. Mariners should expect advisories regarding potential hazards like swells and rip currents, and prepare for adjusted schedules and potential delays.","Port remains open; all vessels may transit but must exercise caution and begin storm preparations, ensuring adequate moorings and readiness to depart if directed."
"Given the Hurricane Watch and potential for significant storm surge and rainfall, Port of Charleston will likely suspend vessel operations and cargo handling within the next 12 hours, prioritizing safety and minimizing potential damage.

***","Ports and waterfront facilities remain open for normal operations; operators should secure hazardous cargo, verify emergency equipment, and begin implementing heavy-weather procedures in anticipation of conditions advancing beyond WHISKEY."
"Given that Florence is forecast to approach the southeastern U.S. coast as a major hurricane within 48 hours, the Port of Charleston will likely implement precautionary operational guidance including potential temporary closures, restricted vessel movements, and heightened security measures to ensure safety and minimize potential damage. These actions will be dictated by evolving weather conditions and directives from relevant authorities.","Cargo and facility operations may continue; facility operators should activate hurricane plans, secure loose equipment, and prepare to suspend operations if conditions escalate."
