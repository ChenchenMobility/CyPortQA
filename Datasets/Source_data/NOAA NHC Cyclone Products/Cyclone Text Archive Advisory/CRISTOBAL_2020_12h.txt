DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cristobal was
located near latitude 19.0 North, longitude 92.1 West. Cristobal is
moving toward the southeast near 2 mph (4 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue this morning, followed by turn toward
the east this afternoon. A motion toward the north-northeast and
north is expected on Thursday and Friday. On the forecast track, the
center will cross the southern Bay of Campeche coast later today.
and move inland over eastern Mexico tonight and Thursday. The center
is forecast to move back over the Bay of Campeche Thursday night and
Friday.
 
Nearby surface observations indicate that maximum sustained winds
have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.  Some
additional increase in strength is possible until the center crosses
the coast.  Gradual weakening is forecast while the center remains
inland, but restrengthening is expected after Cristobal moves back
over water Thursday night and Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on nearby surface
observations is 994 mb (29.35 inches).
