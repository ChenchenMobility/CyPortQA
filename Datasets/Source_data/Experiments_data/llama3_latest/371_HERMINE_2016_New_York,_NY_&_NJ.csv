"Please note that the text does not mention the specific timing of peak impact for freight at New York, NY & NJ. However, based on the discussion and 48-hour outlook provided, it appears that the system is expected to make landfall in Florida, affecting areas such as Indian Pass to Aripeka, before potentially impacting other regions.

As there is no explicit information regarding the predicted peak impact for freight at New York, NY & NJ, I cannot provide an answer.",9/5/2016
"No predictions about freight or any specific location are mentioned in this text. However, if you're asking when the storm's impact might be felt in general, based on the forecast track and timing of the storm's landfall, it seems likely that the peak impact would occur around 02-03-09 (September 2-3).",9/5/2016

"Note: The information provided is based on the given text and does not guarantee accuracy or relevance to the actual situation.

According to the forecast, Tropical Depression Nine is expected to make landfall in Florida by Thursday afternoon. There is no specific mention of the impact on freight at New York, NY & NJ. However, considering the storm's track and the general effects of tropical cyclones, it can be inferred that the impact may persist for a few days.

Assuming the storm's influence extends to the northeastern United States, I would estimate the expected end of impact on freight at New York, NY & NJ to be around 05-08-2016.",9/5/2016
