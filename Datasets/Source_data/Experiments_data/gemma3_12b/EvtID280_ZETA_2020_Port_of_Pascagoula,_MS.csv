"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Zeta's Impact:** The forecast discussion mentions potential impacts on the central Gulf Coast, including Pascagoula, MS. It notes potential for flash flooding and references rainfall.
*   **Event Duration:** The advisory indicates impacts through Wednesday. Let's assume a 3-day event (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) for simplicity.
*   **Vessel Disruption:** Flash flooding and related hazards would likely disrupt port operations, impacting vessel arrivals and departures. However, the specific disruption isn't quantified.
*   **Average Daily Vessels:** The average is 4.11. Disruption would reduce this.

Given the potential for flash flooding, it is likely that operations at the Port of Pascagoula would be significantly disrupted. However, without more specifics, the disruption will be great enough to impact vessel arrivals/departures beyond a few vessels

Therefore, the answer is **C. 10-20 vessels**.",A.
B. 1-10 vessels,A.
