,Isolated tornadoes in outer rainbands; extended period of high seas and dangerous rip currents; prolonged operational disruption due to Harvey’s slow movement.
,Dangerous surf/rip currents and a slight tornado risk in outer rainbands.
Rip currents.,"Prolonged coastal flooding, dangerous surf and rip currents, and isolated tornadoes in feeder bands."
Rip current conditions may become life-threatening along the Port Arthur coastline.,Prolonged heavy rain could close road and rail approaches; strong rip currents and dangerous seas will hinder vessel operations and offshore transfers.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely.,"Dangerous surf and rip currents, prolonged flooding from slow storm motion, possible river and bayou rises affecting terminal access roads and rail lines."

"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Explanation:**

The provided text highlights ""catastrophic flooding"" and ""life-threatening conditions"" expected across a wide area of the Texas coast, including near Port Arthur. Given the severity of the predicted storm surge, rainfall, and wind, it's highly probable that port operations would be suspended for an extended period. Considering the average daily vessel count of roughly 7.3, a significant disruption would likely result in a large number of vessels being impacted over the event's duration.",D.
"B. 1-10 vessels



**Explanation:**

The provided text doesn't mention Port Arthur or the number of vessels expected to be impacted. It discusses rainfall, storm surge, wind, and surf conditions. Therefore, an educated guess must be made with the knowledge that Harvey is a dangerous storm likely to cause port closures. Given the disruption, a small number of vessels (1-10) are likely to be affected, but it's difficult to provide a definitive number without direct information from port authorities.",D.
