DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Two was
estimated by an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft to be near
latitude 30.3 North, longitude 78.5 West. The depression is moving
toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). This general motion,
accompanied by a decrease in forward speed, is expected later today
and on Sunday as the system nears the coast within the warning area.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Recent data from the reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the
tropical cyclone remains just below tropical storm strength.
However, the depression is forecast to become a tropical storm later
today as it moves over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area later tonight or early Sunday.

RAINFALL: The depression is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches from eastern South Carolina through
southeastern North Carolina.

STORM SURGE: Storm surge inundation of 1 to 2 feet above ground
level is possible within the tropical storm warning area.

SURF: This system is expected to produce life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions along portions of the southeastern United
States coast through the weekend. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
