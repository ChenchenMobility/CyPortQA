gusts. The system is expected to develop a well-defined center and
become a tropical storm later tonight or early Saturday, and some 
slight strengthening is possible while it approaches Florida. 
Additional strengthening is possible after the system moves east of 
Florida over the western Atlantic Saturday night and Sunday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Marco Island, FL to Card Sound Bridge...1-3 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Marco Island, FL...1-2 ft

Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas...1-2 ft
Card Sound Bridge to North Miami Beach, FL including Biscayne
Bay...1-2 ft
 
Extreme Northwestern Bahamas: storm surge could raise water levels
by as much 1- 3 ft above normal tide levels.
 
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
