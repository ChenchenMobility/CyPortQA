However, if I *had* to choose based on the structure of the text, the most logical answer would be **D. 48 hours or more**. This is because the document appears to be a forecast for a longer period, and the earliest time for an event to occur is often after a certain amount of time has passed.",A.

"**A. None**

**Explanation:**

The provided text focuses entirely on Hurricane Irma's impact on Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Florida Keys. There is *no mention* of San Juan, Puerto Rico, or any impact on commercial vessels there. Therefore, the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels is none.",B.
A. None,B.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Reasoning:**

The advisory mentions ""s swells generated by Irma are affecting Puerto Rico..."" and ""The upper Florida Keys into southeast Florida..."". This implies a disruption of shipping activities due to hazardous conditions. Given the average daily vessel count of over 11, and the potential for significant disruption over several days (implied by the timeframe of the advisory), it's likely that more than 20 vessels would be impacted.",B.
"A. None



**Explanation:**

The advisory explicitly mentions ""Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"" impacting Puerto Rico. This strongly suggests a hazardous marine environment, making it extremely dangerous for commercial vessels to be in the port of San Juan. It's highly likely that port authorities would order vessels to seek safe harbor elsewhere, resulting in zero commercial vessels at the port during the event.",B.
