"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Reasoning:**

The advisory explicitly mentions ""catastrophic flooding"" and a dangerous storm surge impacting the Texas coast, specifically mentioning Port Mansfield to Sargent and areas around Houston. This level of impact would almost certainly lead to a significant disruption of port operations, leading to vessels being delayed or diverted. Given that the average daily number of vessels is over 65, a disruption of this magnitude would likely impact 20 or more vessels.",D.

"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory mentions potential hurricane conditions and tropical storm conditions impacting the Texas coast, including the Houston area. This would very likely cause port closures and significant disruptions to vessel traffic. Given the average daily vessel count is over 65, a significant event impacting the port would affect more than 20 vessels.",D.
