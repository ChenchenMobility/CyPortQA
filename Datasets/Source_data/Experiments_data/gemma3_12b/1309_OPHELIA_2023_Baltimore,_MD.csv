"Based on the provided text, here's the reasoning to determine the answer:

*   **Location Impact:** The advisory mentions impacts on the Chesapeake Bay and surrounding areas, which includes the approach to Baltimore.
*   **Wind & Surge:** The text describes potential for dangerous conditions including surge and wind. This would disrupt vessel operations.
*   **Rainfall:** Heavy rainfall is predicted, which can further hinder port activities.
*   **Surge Height:** Surge heights of 1-3 feet are predicted for the Upper Chesapeake Bay which includes Baltimore.

Given these factors, significant disruption to vessel traffic is likely. While an exact number isn't provided, the level of impact suggests more than just a few vessels would be affected. It is likely that at least 20 vessels or more would be impacted.

**D. 20 vessels or more**",A.
,A.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Reasoning:**

The advisory specifically mentions a storm surge warning for the entire Chesapeake Bay, including Baltimore, MD. It also warns of tropical storm conditions. Given the average daily number of vessels (14), and the potential for severe disruptions due to the storm surge and tropical storm conditions, it is highly probable that significantly more than 14 vessels would be impacted or delayed, pushing the total impacted number well beyond 20.",A.
