The probability peaks at 18Z Fri, so we need to count backwards from 18Z Fri to 06Z SAT and subtract 4 hours for each hour after that to account for different time zones.

There are 21 hours between 18Z Fri and 06Z SAT, so we subtract 4 hours for each hour after 18Z Fri to get the number of hours remaining until the probability peaks:

21 - 4 = 17

"The question asks for the time in hours remaining until the 50-kt wind probability peaks at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days.

The given information shows that the current wind speed of the tropical depression is 34 kts (39 mph). To determine when the 50-kt wind probability will peak, we need to look for the location and time period that has a cumulative probability of at least 3% for the 50-kt wind speed.

In the given table, the 50-kt wind probability is shown only at High Island, TX. The cumulative probability for the 50-kt wind speed at High Island, TX peaks at 18Z on Sunday (the 3rd day) at 72 hours, with a probability of 1%.

Therefore, to find the time in hours remaining until the 50-kt wind probability peaks at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days, we need to subtract the current time (2100 UTC) from the peak time (18Z on Sunday).

The time difference between 2100 UTC and 18Z on Sunday is:

36 hours - 4 hours (since it's currently 2100 UTC) = 32 hours

So, there are approximately 32 hours remaining until the 50-kt wind probability peaks at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days.",
