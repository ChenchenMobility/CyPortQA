"The provided data does not include Detroit-Wayne County Port, MI. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for that location from the given information.",A.
"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for Detroit-Wayne County Port, MI, we need to look at the forecasted wind speeds for Detroit-Wayne County Port, MI. Since it is not provided in the given data, we can't determine the answer from the given information. However, based on the typical format of such forecasts, we can infer the structure.

Given the structure of the provided for other locations, the highest probability for Detroit-Wayne County Port, MI would likely be indicated in a similar manner. Since the question asks for the interval with the highest probability, we would look for the interval with the highest numeric value in the 34-kt wind column.

Since the data for Detroit-Wayne County Port, MI is not provided, we cannot determine the exact interval. However, if we were to follow the structure of the structure of the provided data, we would look for the interval with the highest value.

Without the specific data, we cannot provide a definitive answer. If we were to guess based on typical patterns, we might infer that the highest probability often occurs within the first 24-48 hours, but this is speculative without the actual data.

Therefore, based on typical patterns and the structure of the provided data provided for other locations, the answer might be:

C. 24-48 hours
