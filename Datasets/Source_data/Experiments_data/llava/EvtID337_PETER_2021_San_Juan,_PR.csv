"San Juan, PR is located at the intersection of 34 KT (39 MPH... 63 KM/H) and 50 KT (58 MPH... 93 KM/H) on the wind speed probability table. The closest weather forecast location to San Juan, PR would be the Bermuda location, which is shown at the top right corner of the table. This location has a cumulative probability of at least 1 percent for sustained winds of at least 50 KT (58 MPH... 93 KM/H) within the next 5 days. The other locations in the table are not as close to San Juan, PR as the Bermuda location is.",None listed for San Juan in advisory wind-probability table

"The image provided contains wind speed probability data for Tropical Storm Peter from the National Hurricane Center. It also includes a table with cumulative probabilities for various wind speeds and locations.

To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at San Juan, PR within the next 5 days, we need to look for the location ""San Juan, PR"" in the table and then find the cumulative probability for 34-kt winds in the respective rows for each time period (18Z Mon to 18Z Thu, 18Z Fri, or 18Z Sat) within the next 5 days.

Looking at the table, we can see that the cumulative probability for 34-kt winds at San Juan, PR starts with a 1 in the ""06Z TUE to 18Z TUE"" row and increases with time. The final cumulative probability for this time period is shown as ""1( 1)"" which means there's a 1% chance of 34-kt winds at San Juan, PR during the entire time period from 06Z Tue to 18Z Tue.

For the next 5 days (from 18Z Tue to 18Z Thu), the cumulative probability for 34-kt winds starts with ""X( X)"" and increases over time, with a final probability of ""6( 7)"" which means there's a 6% chance of 34-kt winds at San Juan, PR during this entire time period.

For the next 5 days (from 18Z Thu to 18Z Fri), the cumulative probability for 34-kt winds starts with ""X( X)"" and increases over time, with a final probability of ""1( 1)"" which means there's a 1% chance of 34-kt winds at San Juan, PR during this entire time period.

For the next 5 days (from 18Z Fri to 18Z Sat), the cumulative probability for 34-kt winds starts with ""X( X)"" and increases over time, with a final probability of ""1( 1)"" which means there's a 1% chance of 34-kt winds at San Juan, PR during this entire time period.

Given that the cumulative probability for 34-kt winds at San Juan, PR increases to at least 6% over the next 5 days (from 18Z Tue to 18Z Thu), but does not meet the 3% criterion for displaying probabilities less than 1%, we can say that there is a cumulative probability of at least 1% for 34-kt winds at San Juan, PR within the next 5 days.

"The image shows Tropical Storm Peter's position near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 60.9 West and indicates that it will pass north of the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico through Tuesday. San Juan, PR is located at approximately latitude 18.32 North and longitude -66.14 West. To determine when San Juan, PR is most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions, we need to estimate the time it takes for Tropical Storm Peter to travel from its current position to San Juan, PR.

The distance between Tropical Storm Peter's current position and San Juan, PR is approximately 580 miles (935 km). Assuming a constant forward speed of 15 mph (24 km/h), it would take approximately 2.87 days (or about 67.16 hours) for Tropical Storm Peter to travel this distance.

Given that Tropical Storm Peter is expected to pass north of the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico through Tuesday, it is most likely that San Juan, PR will begin experiencing tropical storm conditions on Wednesday or Thursday. However, without additional information about Tropical Storm Peter's exact forward speed, the timing could vary slightly.",
