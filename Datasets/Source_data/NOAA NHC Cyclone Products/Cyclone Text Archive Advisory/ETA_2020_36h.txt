DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eta was 
located by satellite and Cuban radar data near latitude 23.2 North, 
longitude 85.1 West. Eta is moving toward the north near 7 mph (11 
km/h). A motion toward the north or north-northeast is forecast 
through Wednesday night, followed by a turn toward the northeast on 
Thursday. On the forecast track the center of Eta will move parallel 
to but offshore of the Florida west coast on Thursday and move near 
or over Apalachee Bay Thursday night and Friday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast through Thursday morning, and Eta
could be near hurricane strength by Wednesday night or Thursday
morning. Gradual weakening is expected to begin Thursday afternoon
or evening.
 
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).

Portions of West Florida and the Sun Coast, including the Tampa Bay 
area:  1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of 4 inches.

Flash and river flooding will be possible in western Cuba, along 
with landslides in areas of higher terrain. Additional flash and 
urban flooding will be possible in South Florida, especially across 
previously inundated areas, and eventually along portions of West 
Florida and the Sun Coast. Flash and urban flooding will also be 
possible for western Cuba.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Dry Tortugas 
overnight and early Wednesday.

area along the Florida west coast by Thursday afternoon. 

SURF:  Swells generated by Eta are expected to affect the north
coast of Cuba, the northwestern Bahamas, southern and western
Florida, and the Florida Keys during the next day or so.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
