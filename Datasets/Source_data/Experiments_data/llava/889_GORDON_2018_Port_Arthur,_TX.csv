"The image shows that the tropical storm is expected to make landfall along the north-central Gulf Coast ""tonight."" Based on this information, we can estimate that Port Arthur, TX is most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions sometime after the time of the advisory and before landfall. Therefore, the answer would be between the time of the advisory (100 PM CDT) and the expected landfall time, which is not provided in the image.",8
