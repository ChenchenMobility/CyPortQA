"Based on the provided text, there's no information about Boston, MA or wind probabilities for any time interval. The text details forecasts for numerous locations, but none of them include Boston. Therefore, it's impossible to answer the question.

**Reasoning:**

The provided text focuses on the Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba, and the Gulf Coast of the US (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia). Boston, MA is far enough north that it is not directly impacted by the storm's projected path or associated hazards (storm surge, heavy rainfall, high winds). Therefore, the number of commercial vessels impacted would be minimal to none.",A.
