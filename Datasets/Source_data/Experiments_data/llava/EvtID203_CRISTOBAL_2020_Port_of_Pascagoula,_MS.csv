"The image you provided shows a map with a tropical cyclone named ""Cristobal"" in the Gulf of Mexico. Based on this information, the coastal regions that are most likely to be affected by Cristobal include:

1. Southeastern United States - This includes parts of the Gulf Coast states such as Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Specifically, major ports like Houston, Corpus Christi, Port Arthur, New Orleans, Mobile, and Pensacola could be affected.

2. Cuba - The Cuban coastline is also within the cone of the tropical cyclone. Major ports such as Havana and Santiago de Cuba might be impacted.

3. Yucatan Peninsula - This includes parts of Mexico, such as Cancun and Cozumel, which could experience rough seas and strong winds.

These regions are most likely to be affected by the tropical cyclone due to their proximity to the storm's projected path. However, it is important to note that hurricane tracks can change over time, so the actual impacted areas may vary.","Entire north-central Gulf Coast from upper Texas coast eastward through Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and western Florida Panhandle"

"The image shows a tropical storm advisory for Tropical Storm Cristobal. Based on this information, I cannot provide the exact end date of the expected impact on freight at Port of Pascagoula, MS because the advisory does not include that specific detail. However, it indicates that rainfall from Cristobal may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in several areas, including along the Pacific coasts of Chiapas, Guatemala, and El Salvador, as well as isolated amounts up to 25 inches in parts of Tabasco, Veracruz, and Campeche.

For the most accurate and current information regarding the impact of Cristobal on freight at Port of Pascagoula, MS, it would be best to monitor local weather forecasts and updates from the port authority or relevant local government agency.",6/5/2020

"The image shows a tropical storm forecast map from the National Hurricane Center. Based on the information provided, it is difficult to estimate the exact date when the impact on freight at Port of Pascagoula will end, as this depends on various factors such as the strength and duration of the storm, the speed of recovery efforts, and the potential for further storms or weather events.

However, we can infer that if the storm is expected to make landfall around June 1st, it may affect freight operations at Port of Pascagoula for a period that could range from several days to a couple of weeks, depending on the severity and duration of the storm. After the storm has passed, recovery efforts would typically commence, but it is not clear when these efforts will be sufficient to resume normal operations at the port.",6/5/2020
