"The image depicts Hurricane Isaias, which at the time of the advisory was located near latitude 22.9 North and longitude 75.9 West. It is moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and a general northwestward motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected for the next day or so, followed by a turn toward the north-northwest by late Sunday. The center of Isaias will move near or over the Central Bahamas tonight, near or over the Northwestern Bahamas Saturday and near the east coast of the Florida peninsula Saturday afternoon through Sunday.

It is important to note that the advisory was issued at 8:00 PM EDT (0000 UTC) on July 31, 2020, and therefore, the forecast information contained in the advisory may no longer be valid.
