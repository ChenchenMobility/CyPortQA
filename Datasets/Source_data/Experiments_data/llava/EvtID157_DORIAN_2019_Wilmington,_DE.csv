"The forecast for Wilmington, DE shows the 34-kt wind probability peaking on day 91. To determine the number of hours remaining until this peak, we can use the following equation:

hours remaining = (peak time in GMT - current GMT) x 24 + 1

Assuming that the current GMT is around 07:00 pm EST, which corresponds to 00:00 pm UTC, we can calculate the number of hours remaining as follows:

hours remaining = (91 - (07:00 pm EST - 23:45 pm EST)) x 24 + 1
= 46.8 hours
