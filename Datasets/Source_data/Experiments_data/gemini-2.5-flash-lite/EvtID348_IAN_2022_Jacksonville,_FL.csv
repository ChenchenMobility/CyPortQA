"* Vessel operations at Jacksonville, FL should be on alert for increasing probabilities of tropical storm-force winds starting late Tuesday and continuing through Saturday, with a 33% chance of experiencing these winds by Saturday.
* While direct hurricane conditions are less likely in Jacksonville, precautionary measures should be considered due to the potential for tropical storm-force winds and associated storm surge.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"*   Jacksonville, FL has a 7% chance of experiencing tropical storm force winds by Tuesday afternoon, increasing to 20% by Thursday afternoon.
*   Given the increasing probability of tropical storm-force winds over the next 120 hours, general vessel activity should monitor advisories and prepare for potential disruptions.","Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida that cannot offload and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"*   Jacksonville, FL has a low probability (3-6%) of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds by Saturday, October 1st.
*   Given the minimal wind threat to Jacksonville, current operational guidance for ocean-going and commercial vessels would likely allow for continued operations with standard storm preparedness measures in place.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"*  Jacksonville, FL has a 20% probability of experiencing tropical storm-force winds (39+ mph) by Thursday, September 29th.

"* Port operations at Jacksonville, FL should prepare for increasing tropical storm-force wind probabilities (15-19% cumulative chance by Saturday) as Hurricane Ian tracks northward.
* While direct hurricane conditions are not currently forecast, ports should monitor for potential impacts from heavy rainfall and storm surge as the storm moves inland.","Ports and waterfront facilities should continue storm preparations, ensure the inventory of vessels is minimized, and remind users that the facilities do not provide safe haven during the storm."
"*   **Jacksonville, FL, is currently forecast to experience tropical storm force winds with a cumulative probability of 20% by Thursday afternoon (5 PM EDT).**
*   **The National Hurricane Center advises monitoring Ian's progress and recommends preparations to protect life and property to be rushed to completion if a Hurricane Warning is issued for the area.**",Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and all transfer operations may continue while Condition WHISKEY is in effect.
"Based on the provided data, Jacksonville, FL has a 20% chance of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds within the next 12 hours (from 06Z Mon to 18Z Mon). Due to this low probability and the current inland trajectory of the storm, general vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL is unlikely to be significantly impacted in the immediate 12-hour timeframe.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"As of 5:00 PM EDT on Sunday, September 25, 2022, Tropical Storm Ian is located near 16.2°N latitude and 80.3°W longitude, moving west-northwest at 12 mph.

*   **Jacksonville, FL:** The probability of experiencing tropical storm-force winds (>= 39 mph) at Jacksonville, FL within the next 24 hours is between 17% and 21%. This suggests that while there is a risk, it is not a certainty, and operational guidance might lean towards caution and monitoring rather than immediate cessation of all vessel activity.
*   **Operational Guidance:** Vessels in Jacksonville, FL should continue to monitor the storm's progress and advisories from the National Hurricane Center. Preparations for potential tropical storm conditions, including securing vessels and cargo, should be considered if forecasts indicate an increasing likelihood of impacts.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"Based on the provided information, Jacksonville, FL has a 17% chance of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds (39+ mph) within 36 hours.

Therefore, general vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL may need to prepare for potential disruptions due to tropical storm conditions.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."

"Based on the provided data, the probability of tropical-storm-force winds (34 kt) at Jacksonville, FL at the time in 12 hours is less than 1%. Therefore, general vessel activity should not be significantly impacted by tropical storm-force winds at that specific time.","Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida that cannot offload and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"Based on the provided graphics, Jacksonville, FL has a 27% chance of experiencing tropical storm-force winds (34-38 mph) within the next 120 hours, with a 13% chance of hurricane-force winds (64+ mph). This indicates a moderate to high likelihood of significant weather impacts.

Therefore, general vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL should anticipate **suspension or severe disruption** due to the potential for tropical storm and hurricane-force winds, as well as storm surge. Ports will likely be closed and all vessels will need to seek safe harbor well in advance of expected arrival.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"Based on the provided data, there is a low probability (<5%) of tropical storm-force winds reaching Jacksonville, FL in the next 24 hours. Therefore, general vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL should be able to continue operating as normal at this time, with close monitoring of forecast updates.","Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida that cannot offload and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"*   Vessel operations at Jacksonville, FL should prepare for increasing chances of tropical storm-force winds by the 72-hour mark, with a 14% probability of sustained winds of at least 39 mph.
*   While significant impact is not immediate, port authorities should monitor the forecast closely as the probability of tropical storm-force winds increases by 18Z Monday, reaching 14% by that time.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."

"*   Vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL should anticipate a **low probability of encountering tropical storm-force winds (39+ mph)** at the 84-hour mark, with the cumulative probability being 10%.
*   Given the current track and forecast, the most significant impacts are expected further south along the Florida coast, with Jacksonville potentially experiencing only marginal winds at that time.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"*   Ocean-going and commercial vessel activity at Jacksonville, FL is unlikely to be impacted by tropical storm-force winds in the next 12 hours, as the probability of such conditions is less than 1%.
*   However, port operations should continue to monitor Ian's track and intensity as the storm is forecast to strengthen and approach the Florida west coast.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
"*   Jacksonville, FL has a low probability (4%) of experiencing tropical storm force winds in the next 24 hours (by 2 PM EDT Monday, September 26).
*   Given the low probability of tropical storm force winds, current operational guidance would likely be to continue normal operations, with a close watch maintained on the storm's track and intensity.","Mariners are advised that there are no safe havens in port; all ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart early to avoid bridge closures and keep the number of vessels in port to a minimum."
