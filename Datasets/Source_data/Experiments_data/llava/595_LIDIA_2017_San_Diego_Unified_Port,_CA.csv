"The image you've provided is a weather map that indicates the projected path and intensity of a tropical cyclone, specifically Tropical Storm Lidia. The map shows a cone that forecasts the storm's trajectory, along with its estimated maximum wind speed as it moves over the ocean.

As of the time the image was created, the National Hurricane Center is predicting that Tropical Storm Lidia will most likely affect ports in Baja California, which is located on the west coast of Mexico. This region includes a number of significant ports, including but not limited to:

1. Port of Cabo San Lucas
2. Port of La Paz
3. Port of Mazatln
4. Port of Manzanillo
5. Port of Acapulco
6. Port of Salina Cruz

There are no other hazards shown in the image.,High surf and dangerous rip currents along the Southern California coast beginning this weekend
The possible future storm may cause disruptions to maritime operations in the port.,Increased surf and dangerous rip currents along Southern California beaches Sunday–Monday.
Floods in coastal areas of Baja California Sur,"Large swells may reach southern California beaches early next week, producing strong rip currents that could affect small-craft operations."
The track of the storm could lead to disruptions in maritime transportation if it comes too close to San Diego.,Long-period south-southwest swells could produce elevated surf and rip-current risk along San Diego beaches this weekend and early next week.
"The image shows a track forecast cone for a cyclone, indicating its potential path over the next few days, which may impact operations at the San Diego Unified Port in California.",Long-period swells creating higher surf and dangerous rip currents along the Southern California coast beginning late week-end.
