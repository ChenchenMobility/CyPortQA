Bermuda,Surf and rip-current conditions mainly along the Outer Banks of North Carolina; no direct impact expected along the Georgia coast
MOREHEAD CITY,CAPE HATTERAS NC (closest point listed in probability table)
"The provided data does not include the Port of Savannah, GA. However, based on the nearest locations (Cape Hatteras and Morehead City), and considering the typical behavior of tropical systems and their forecast tracks, we can estimate the probability. Given that both Cape Hatteras and Morehead City have a cumulative probability of less than 5%, and considering the Port of Savannah's relative distance and typical storm tracks, a reasonable estimate for the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at the Port of Savannah within the next 5 days would be around:
