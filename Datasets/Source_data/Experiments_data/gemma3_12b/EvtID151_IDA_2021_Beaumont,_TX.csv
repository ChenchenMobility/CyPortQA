D. 20 vessels or more,C.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory indicates that the system ""could be near major hurricane strength when it approaches the U.S. northern Gulf coast on Sunday."" Beaumont, TX is a major port on the northern Gulf Coast. Major hurricanes typically lead to significant port closures and disruptions. Given the average daily vessel count of 12.45 and the potential for a major hurricane, it's highly likely that the number of vessels impacted would exceed 20, resulting in a significant disruption and potential evacuation/sheltering of vessels.",C.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The provided text indicates that Tropical Depression Nine is likely to approach the northern Gulf Coast on Sunday and impact areas with rainfall beginning early Sunday. Beaumont, TX is located on the northern Gulf Coast. The text suggests potential for ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"" and ""rainfall...likely to begin impacting portions of the central U.S. Gulf Coast by early Sunday."" Given these conditions and potential for disruption, it's reasonable to expect a significant number of commercial vessels to be impacted, potentially leading to delays or sheltering, exceeding a typical daily average.",C.
