The maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h), with higher gusts, and it is expected to become a hurricane tonight or on Sunday.

The rainfall accumulations through Monday are expected to be 2-4 inches (50-100 mm) in far western Cuba and 1-3 inches (25-75 mm) in eastern portions of the Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucatan, with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches (150 mm) possible. Central U.S. Gulf Coast is expected to receive 1-3 inches (25-75 mm), with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches (125 mm).
