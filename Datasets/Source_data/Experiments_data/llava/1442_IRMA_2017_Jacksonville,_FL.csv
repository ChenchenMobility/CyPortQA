"The image you have provided appears to be a map from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showing the forecast track and cone for a tropical system or hurricane. The image includes various graphics, text, and icons overlaid on top of the base map.

The specific coastal area that is under a Tropical Storm Warning or Hurricane Warning is not clearly labeled or depicted within the visible part of the image. The areas under such warnings are typically shown with colored shading to indicate the level of warning, such as Tropical Storm Watch, Hurricane Watch, or Hurricane Warning. In this case, the area under watch or warning would be indicated by a specific color code and possibly highlighted with a different shade than the rest of the map.

The image also shows various other features like landmasses, bodies of water, and annotations that provide information about the track forecast. However, without clear labels for the coastal areas under warnings, it's not possible to determine the specific location from this image alone.","Volusia/Brevard County Line southward around the Florida peninsula to Anclote River, Florida Keys, Lake Okeechobee, Florida Bay"

Explanation: The probability of gale force winds (34kt) in the given time intervals is likely to decrease over time. Initially, there's a moderate chance of gale force winds within the next 12 hours as Hurricane Irma moves towards the Florida Keys and the west coast of Florida. However, as the storm moves inland, the probability of gale force winds decreases due to land interaction and weakening of the storm. By 96 hours, it's unlikely that any area will experience gale force winds.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '13%', 'in 48h': '4%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '0%'}"

The gale force probability (34kt) for the next 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours is 0 for both the first and second advisories, indicating that gale force winds are not expected during these time intervals. However, during the 48-hour period from the 48-hour to 72-hour mark, there is a 1% chance of gale force winds, which is considered a low probability. Similarly, during the 72-hour period from the 72-hour to 96-hour mark, there is also a 1% chance of gale force winds.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '5%', 'in 96h': '37%'}"

Note: The gale force probability (34kt) is typically a categorical variable that indicates the likelihood of gale-force winds (>34 kt or 18 mph) at a given location and time. In this case, the JSON implies that there is no chance of gale-force winds occurring within the next 96 hours according to the information provided in the advisory.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '1%'}"
