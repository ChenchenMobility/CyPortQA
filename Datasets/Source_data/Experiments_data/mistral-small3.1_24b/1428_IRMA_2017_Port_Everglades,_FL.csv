"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Port Everglades, FL within the next 5 days, we need to locate the relevant data for Port Everglades, FL (which is near Fort Lauderdale) in the provided table.

Port Everglades, FL is not explicitly listed, but Fort Lauderdale is a nearby location that can be used as a proxy. The probabilities for Fort Lauderdale are as follows:

- Day 1: 3
- Day 2: 10
- Day 3: 18
- Day 4: 14
- Day 5: 14

To find the cumulative probability, we sum these probabilities:

3 + 10 + 18 + 14 + 14 = 59

So, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Port Everglades, FL within the next 5 days is:

59",88%
"Based on the provided data, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Port Everglades, FL within the next 5 days is not directly given. However, we can infer the probability from the closest available data points.

Miami Beach, FL:
- 34-kt wind arrival probability within the next 5 days: 99%

Hollywood, FL:
- 34-kt wind arrival probability within the next 5 days: 99%

Given that both nearby locations have a 99% probability, it is reasonable to estimate that the cumulative probability for Port Everglades, FL, would be similar.

Since the probabilities for Days 4 and 5 are not provided, we will sum the probabilities for Days 1, 2, and 3.

"The data provided does not include specific wind probabilities for Port Everglades, FL. However, based on the closest available data for ""Ft. Lauderdale"" or ""Miami"" as a proxy, the highest 34-kt wind probability is indicated for:

C. 24-48 hours",C.
"The forecast data provided does not include specific data for Port Everglades, FL. However, the closest relevant location is likely Homestead, FL (WHITING FLD FL). Based on the provided data for WHITING FLD FL:

- 0-12 hours: 6
- 12-24 hours: 6
- 24-48 hours: 6
- 48 hours or more: 7

The highest 34-kt wind probability is in the interval of 48 hours or more.

So, the answer is:
D. 48 hours or more",D.
"The data provided does not include information for Port Everglades, FL. However, based on the format of the data, we can infer the likely time intervals and their corresponding wind probabilities if such data existed.

Given the structure of the data, the probabilities for different time intervals are as follows:

- The first column (e.g., 99) indicates the probability for 0-12 hours.
- The second column (e.g., X(99)) indicates the probability for 12-24 hours.
- The third column (e.g., X(99)) indicates the probability for 24-48 hours.
- The fourth column (e.g., X(99)) indicates the probability for 48 hours or more.

Since the question asks for the highest 34-kt wind probability for Port Everglades, FL, and we do not have specific data for this location, we cannot determine the exact interval. However, if we were to follow the structure of the data provided, we would look for the highest value in the respective columns.

If we assume the data for Port Everglades would follow a similar pattern, we would look for the highest value in the 34-kt wind probability column. Since the question specifically asks for the highest probability, we would choose the interval with the highest value.

Given the structure and the lack of specific data, we can infer that the highest probability would likely be in the initial time intervals, as probabilities tend to decrease over time.

Without specific data, we cannot definitively answer the question. However, based on the structure and typical patterns, the highest probability would likely be in the earliest time intervals.

If we were to guess based on typical patterns, we would choose:

A. 0-12 hours",D.
"The data provided does not include specific information about Port Everglades, FL. However, it does include data for Fort Lauderdale, FL, which is near Port Everglades. Assuming the data for Fort Lauderdale can be used as a proxy for Port Everglades, we can analyze the probabilities.

Looking at the data for Fort Lauderdale, FL:
- 0-12 hours: 95
- 12-24 hours: X
- 24-48 hours: X
- 48 hours or more: X

The highest probability for 34-kt winds is in the 0-12 hours interval.

Therefore, the answer is:
A. 0-12 hours",D.
"The provided data does not include specific information for Port Everglades, FL. However, if we assume that the data for ""Z"" represents Port Everglades, FL, the highest 34-kt wind probability is indicated in the 24-48 hours interval.

So, the answer is:
C. 24-48 hours",D.
"Port Everglades, FL is not listed in the data provided. However, based on the closest relevant location, Fort Lauderdale, we can infer the answer. Fort Lauderdale is not listed either, but we can use the closest data point, which is Miami. Looking at the data for Miami, the highest probability of 34-kt winds is in the interval ""48 hours or more.""

So the answer is:
D. 48 hours or more",D.
