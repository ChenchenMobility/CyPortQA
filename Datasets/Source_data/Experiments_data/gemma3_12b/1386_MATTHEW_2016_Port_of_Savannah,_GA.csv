"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory highlights significant rainfall amounts (6-12 inches, with potential for 15 inches) and dangerous surf conditions along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts. Port operations are highly susceptible to disruptions from heavy rainfall, flooding, and high surf. Given the potential severity of the event, a substantial impact on vessel traffic is expected. The warning explicitly mentions dangerous conditions impacting the area, and a ""substantial impact"" would result in more than 20 vessels being impacted.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more

**Reasoning:**

*   **Severity:** Matthew is predicted to be an extremely dangerous hurricane, impacting a large area.
*   **Port of Savannah Impact:** Savannah is directly within the predicted path of heavy rainfall and potential surge.
*   **Safety Protocols:** Port operations almost always shut down prior to a hurricane's impact for safety reasons. Shutdown and safety protocols trigger a significant and near complete halt to all commercial vessel traffic.
*   **Event Duration:** The ""entire event"" includes days before, during, and after, meaning that several days worth of missed arrivals/departures would be impacted.
*   **Average daily number of vessels:** A missing total of 15.42379069 *3+ is over 46 vessels total which is only possible if the predicted amount of vessels at Port of Savannah over the entire event is 20 or more.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory explicitly mentions the possibility of hurricane conditions impacting the area from north of Fernandina Beach to Edisto Beach, which includes Savannah, GA. It warns of life-threatening inundation. Given the scale of the event and the potential for disruption, a significant number of vessels would likely be impacted, exceeding 20.",D.
"Based on the provided text and the context of Hurricane Matthew's potential impact, the correct answer is **D. 20 vessels or more**.

Here's why:

*   **Life-threatening inundation:** The advisory specifically mentions the potential for ""life-threatening inundation"" along the Florida east coast, extending to the area around Savannah, GA.
*   **Port Disruption:** Such conditions would almost certainly lead to significant port disruptions.
*   **High Vessel Numbers:** Given the average daily vessel count of over 15, a significant disruption would likely impact a substantial number of vessels, pushing the total affected number well above 20.



**Important Note:** This is an estimate based on the provided text and general knowledge of hurricane impacts on ports. A precise number would require more detailed operational data.",D.

**Explanation:**

While the provided text doesn't give a direct answer about the Port of Savannah, the advisory details significant impacts from Hurricane Matthew across a wide area including Cuba, Haiti, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Turks
