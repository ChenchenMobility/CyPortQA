Explanation: The gale force probability (34kt) is expected to be present in the future forecasts for the first 12, 24, and 48 hours. However, after that, there is a decreasing likelihood of gale force winds as the storm weakens over time. Therefore, the probability is marked as false for the 96-hour forecast.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '3%', 'in 96h': '19%'}"

"The image depicts an NWS National Hurricane Center advisory on Tropical Storm Florence, which is moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and is expected to approach the coasts of North and South Carolina later today, then move near or over the coast of southern North Carolina and eastern South Carolina in the hurricane warning area tonight and Friday. A slow motion over eastern South Carolina is forecast Friday night through Saturday night. Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher gusts, little change in strength is expected before the center reaches the coast, with weakening expected after the center moves inland. The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).",2

"The image shows a tropical depression, not a storm surge warning. It is difficult to determine the duration of freight disruptions in a particular area from a general advisory, but it is clear that the storm has the potential to cause significant impacts and disruptions to coastal areas of the southeastern United States.",2
This information is not provided in the image. It would depend on the specific area and how far away the storm is from that location.,2
"The forecast track shows that Hurricane Florence will move over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and the Bahamas Tuesday and Wednesday, and approach the coast of South Carolina or North Carolina on Thursday.",2

The text does not provide information about the duration of the storm or its impact on the port's freight.,2
"I cannot predict the exact number of days it will take for the port's freight to recover, as it depends on various factors such as the severity of the storm and the effectiveness of recovery efforts. However, based on previous hurricanes and their impacts on ports and supply chains, it is not uncommon for recovery efforts to take several weeks or even months. It is important for businesses and individuals in affected areas to prepare for potential disruptions and delays in transportation and logistics.",2.0

"It is not possible for me to accurately predict how many days it will take for the port's freight to recover from the storm, as this will depend on the severity of the storm, the extent of any damage caused, and the resources available for recovery and restoration efforts. Additionally, it may be some time before it is safe and practical to assess the full impact of the storm on the port and its operations.",2.0
