"The table shows hourly wind speeds in Baltimore, MD for the next 5 days. To determine how many hours remain until the 50-knot wind speed is reached within this time period, we need to find when the wind speed reaches or exceeds 50 knots.

Looking at the forecast for Baltimore, MD, we can see that the highest wind speed of 51 knots occurs at hour 280 on day 3. To calculate how many hours remain until this time, we need to subtract the current hour (hour 0) from this time:

Hours remaining = Hour of peak wind - Current hour
                  = 280 - 0
                  = 280 hours

Explanation: The gale force probability (34kt) in future 12,24,48,72 and 96 hours is evaluated to be 5. This means there is a 50% chance that gale force winds will be observed during the specified time periods. The probability decreases to 0 after 96 hours. This evaluation is based on the information provided in the image, which suggests that the system may become a tropical storm, but it is currently a tropical depression with winds near 35 mph (55 km/h).","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '0%'}"
