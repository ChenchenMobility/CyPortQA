Tornadoes and rip currents.,Isolated tornado risk cannot be ruled out inland; potential river/urban flooding impacts port operations
Tornadoes are possible.,Low-end risk of isolated brief tornadoes inland if remnants track nearby; possible minor river rises but no significant flooding forecast.
Tornadoes may be possible,Localized river or urban flooding from persistent rain bands
Tornadoes are possible.,None
Tornadoes and rip currents are possible.,Urban and small-stream flooding could disrupt terminal trucking and rail access
Tornadoes,Very low tornado risk associated with remnant frontal interaction
Tornadoes,"Minor river/urban ponding possible if localized downpours occur, but no significant marine or port operational hazards anticipated"
Tornadoes,Up-river flooding on Delaware River could be aggravated if heavy upstream rainfall occurs; supply-chain delays likely from Gulf-coast impacts.
Tornadoes may occur.,None anticipated
