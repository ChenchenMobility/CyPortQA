Tornadoes are possible.,Low tornado threat confined to north Florida and southeast Georgia – not expected near PortMiami.
Tornadoes are a possible additional hazard.,Increased rip-current risk and higher surf along the southeast Florida beaches Thursday–Friday.
Isolated tornadoes are possible.,Isolated tornado risk mainly across central–north Florida; not expected in the Miami area
Coastal erosion.,Isolated tornadoes or waterspouts possible in outer rain-bands; brief interruptions to port operations from heavy rain and squalls
Flash flooding and mudslides could be additional hazards.,"Brief tornadoes in outer bands cannot be ruled out, and elevated seas/short-period swell could disrupt pilot transfers and container-handling operations."
Coastal erosion and hazardous marine conditions.,Dangerous rip currents along the southeast Florida beaches and a low tornado risk in outer rain-bands.
Potential hazards could include disruptions to shipping and port operations.,Localized street flooding and reduced visibility may disrupt port and road operations
"Coastal erosion may occur at PortMiami, FL due to the possible future storm.",Hazardous seas and rip currents for vessels entering/exiting Government Cut; localized street flooding during peak downpours.
"Coastal erosion could be an additional hazard at PortMiami, FL.",Ponding on terminal yards and roadway flooding may disrupt port truck traffic.
