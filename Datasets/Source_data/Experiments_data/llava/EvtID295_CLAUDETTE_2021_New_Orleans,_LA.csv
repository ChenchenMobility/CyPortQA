The image only mentions that the storm may cause heavy rain to expand across southeastern Mississippi, southern and central Alabama, and central Georgia resulting in rainfall totals of 3 to 5 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 7 inches.",6/24/2021
"The image you've provided appears to be a forecast map from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicating the potential track and intensity of Tropical Cyclone Three over the Gulf of Mexico. The map shows that the storm is expected to make landfall along the northern Gulf Coast late Friday or early Saturday, with heavy rainfall and flooding likely in areas from Intracoastal City, Louisiana, to the Alabama/Florida border, including Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and Metropolitan New Orleans. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).

"The image you've provided appears to be a meteorological advisory or forecast from the National Weather Service (NWS) for a system that has been given the designation of ""Potential Tropical Cyclone Three"" by the NWS. It is important to note that this image provides information relevant to the Gulf Coast region in the United States, specifically in Louisiana and parts of Alabama and Mississippi.

The advisory indicates that the system is forecasted to make landfall along the north-central Gulf Coast tonight or early Saturday. The wind speeds are expected to be in the range of 45 mph (75 km/h), which is considered tropical storm force, although the exact intensity at landfall is uncertain.

The advisory also mentions heavy rainfall, with totals expected to reach 4 to 8 inches (100 to 200 mm) across portions of the Central Gulf Coast. Flash flooding is a concern as well as new and renewed minor to isolated moderate river flooding. A storm surge is forecasted for areas along the coast, with potential impacts on Morgan City, LA to Okaloosa/Walton County Line, FL, Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas, and areas between Panama City, FL and Cameron, LA.

Additionally, there's a threat of tornadoes in coastal Louisiana tonight.

The next advisory from the NWS is expected at 700 PM CDT (2300 UTC) for an intermediate update on Potential Tropical Cyclone Three, and a complete advisory is expected at 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC).

The image contains various maps and forecast data related to the system's movement, intensity, and potential impacts. It also includes a brief discussion section with information on the expected path of the storm, its wind speed, and the timing of landfall.
