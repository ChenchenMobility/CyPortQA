"The image you've provided shows a tropical storm track and advisory from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). However, it does not provide information about the timing of peak impact on freight in Mobile, AL.

The advisory indicates that Tropical Depression Six is moving toward the east near 8 mph (13 km/h), and a turn toward the northeast and an increase in forward speed are expected tonight or Tuesday. The depression is forecast to move offshore of the east-central Florida coast early Tuesday.

To answer your question, you would need to refer to the latest advisory from the NHC, which will provide updated information on the storm's track and intensity. Once the storm has developed into a tropical storm or hurricane and is predicted to have an impact on freight at Mobile, AL, the date of peak impact can be determined.",None
"The image shows a weather bulletin discussing Tropical Depression Six, which is forecast to bring heavy rainfall and tropical storm conditions to parts of Florida. It mentions that the depression is currently moving toward the east near 8 mph (13 km/h) and is expected to move offshore of the east-central Florida coast early Tuesday. The advisory also states that little change in strength is forecast during the next 48 hours, with maximum sustained winds near 35 mph (55 km/h) at the time of the bulletin.

Regarding your question about when is the expected end of impact on freight at Mobile, AL, without additional context or information from the National Weather Service, I'm unable to provide a date in DD-MM-YYYY format for the end of impact on freight at Mobile, AL due to the current information available.",None
