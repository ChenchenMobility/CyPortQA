"The image shows that Nicholas is expected to produce rainfall of 8 to 16 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches across portions of the middle and upper Texas coastal areas through the middle of the week. This may lead to life-threatening flash and urban flooding impacts, especially in highly urbanized metropolitan areas such as Lake Charles Harbor District, LA. It is most likely that this district will begin experiencing tropical storm conditions some time within the next 36 hours, as indicated by the storm surge warning and the expected rainfall totals from Nicholas.",8
