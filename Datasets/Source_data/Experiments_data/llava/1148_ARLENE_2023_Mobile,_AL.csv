"Based on the provided Future Wind Probability Table and assuming that Mobile, AL is within the forecast region for Tropical Storm Arlene, the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Mobile, AL within the next 5 days is 7%. This can be calculated by adding up the probabilities for each time period in which there is a greater than 1% chance of 50-kt winds and multiplying it by 1.08 (to convert from cumulative to forecast probability). Note that this calculation assumes that the probabilities are independent and that there is no additional information available about the specific location and time periods within the forecast region for Tropical Storm Arlene.",0%
