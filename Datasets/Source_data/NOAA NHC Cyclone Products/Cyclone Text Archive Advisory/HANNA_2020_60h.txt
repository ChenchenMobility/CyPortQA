DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eight
was located near latitude 26.0 North, longitude 90.4 West.  The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h),
and this general motion is expected during the next few days.  On
the forecast track, the center of the depression is expected to move
across the northwestern Gulf of Mexico today and Friday and make
landfall along the Texas coast on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slow strengthening is expected, and the depression could
become a tropical storm in a day or so.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by late Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  The tropical depression is expected to produce 3 to 5
inches of rain with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches through
Monday along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the Lower Texas Coast,
and inland through south-central Texas and the Rio Grande Valley.
These rains may result in flash flooding across the west-central
Gulf Coast into portions of south Texas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to increase
and affect much of the Texas and Louisiana coasts in a day or two.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
