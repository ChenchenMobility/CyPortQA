"The highest 34-kt wind probability for Manatee County Port, FL is in the interval:

C. 24-48 hours",C.
"The provided data does not include specific information for ""Manatee County Port, FL."" However, if we assume the closest relevant location is ""TAMPA, FL,"" which is listed in the data, we can analyze the probabilities for that location.

For TAMPA, FL at 34-kt winds:
- 0-12 hours: 2
- 12-24 hours: 49
- 24-48 hours: 51
- 48 hours or more: X (not applicable)

The highest probability is in the 24-48 hours interval.

So, the answer is: C. 24-48 hours",D.
"The table does not explicitly list ""Manatee County Port, FL."" However, it does list ""BRADENTON, FL,"" which is located within Manatee County. Assuming ""Manatee County Port, FL"" refers to Bradenton, FL, we can proceed with the analysis.

Looking at the probabilities for Bradenton, FL (34-kt winds):
- 0-12 hours: 16
- 12-24 hours: 78
- 24-48 hours: 5
- 48 hours or more: 0

The highest probability is in the 12-24 hours interval.

So the answer is:

B. 12-24 Hours",C.
"The table provided does not contain data for ""Manatee County Port, FL."" However, based on the available locations, ""WHITING FLD FL"" seems to be the closest relevant entry. Using the data for ""WHITING FLD FL,"" the highest 34-kt wind probability is found in the interval:
