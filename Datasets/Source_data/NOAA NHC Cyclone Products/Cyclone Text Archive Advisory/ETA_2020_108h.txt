DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM EST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eta was
located near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 80.7 West. Eta is moving
toward the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue tonight.  A turn toward the north and 
northwest at a slower forward speed is expected on Sunday and Sunday 
night, followed by a westward motion on Monday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Eta will cross central Cuba tonight, approach 
south Florida and the Florida Keys on Sunday, and pass near or over 
south Florida and the Florida Keys Sunday night and Monday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is possible through Sunday night, and Eta could 
be near hurricane strength as it approaches Florida.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Eta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC, and on the
web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Eta is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Thursday morning:
 
Jamaica: An additional 2 to 4 inches (50 to 125 mm), isolated
maximum storm totals of 15 inches (380 mm).
 
The Cayman Islands into portions of Cuba: an additional 5 to 10
inches (200 to 400 mm), isolated maximum storm totals of 25 inches
(650 mm).
 
The Bahamas and portions of the central and southern Florida
peninsula, including the Keys: 6 to 12 inches (150 to 300 mm),
isolated maximum totals of 18 inches (450 mm).
 
Significant, life-threatening flash and river flooding will be
possible in Cuba, along with landslides in areas of higher terrain.
Flash and urban flooding will also be possible for the Cayman
Islands, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Southern Florida.  Isolated minor
river flooding is also possible for Central Florida.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Bonita Beach, FL to Golden Beach, FL including Biscayne Bay...2-4 ft
Florida Keys from Ocean Reef to the Dry Tortugas including Florida
Bay...2-4 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line to Altamaha Sound...2-3 ft
Golden Beach to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands
for a few more hours, as well as in the warning areas in Cuba
tonight and Sunday, in the northwestern Bahamas on Sunday, and in
south Florida and the Florida Keys late Sunday and Sunday night.
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area in
Florida Sunday night and Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the tropical storm watch area in Cuba tonight and
Sunday and in the watch area in Florida by late Sunday or early
Monday.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur Sunday evening and Sunday
night over south Florida and the Keys.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Eta are expected to spread northeastward
and affect the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, the southern coast of
Cuba, the northwestern Bahamas, and southern Florida and the
Florida Keys during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
