"A treasure trove of cryptic data!

After carefully parsing the text, I found the relevant information:

`TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM`

This is a weather forecast disseminated by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The `TTAA00` code indicates that this is a Tropical Cyclone Advisory, and the `DDHHMM` code specifies the date and time of the forecast.

The text also contains probabilistic information about the arrival of 34-kt winds at various locations. Specifically:

`34 X   X( X)   8( 8)  30(38)`

This indicates that, according to the forecast, there is an `X`% probability (where `X` is unknown) of 34-kt wind arrival within the next 5 days at Canaveral Port District, FL.

To calculate the cumulative probability, we need to know the value of `X`. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the text. Therefore, I cannot give you a specific answer.

However, if you have access to the full forecast data or can provide more context, I'd be happy to help you estimate the cumulative probability.",5%
