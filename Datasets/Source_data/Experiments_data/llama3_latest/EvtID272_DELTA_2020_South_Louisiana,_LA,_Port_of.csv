"The forecast is written in a cryptic format, but I can help you extract the information.

According to the forecast, the 50-kt wind probability peak time for Port of South Louisiana, LA, is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can look at the reports around that location and find the closest peak time.

For example, in the report for Port Arthur TX (around 30 miles east of Lake Charles, LA), the 50-kt wind probability peaks at 14Z (10:00 AM CDT) on the 4th day. 

Since you asked about South Louisiana, we can look at the reports around that area. For instance, in the report for Galveston TX (around 150 miles east of Lake Charles, LA), the 50-kt wind probability peaks at 12Z (8:00 AM CDT) on the 3rd day.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between these peak times and the current time. Since this is a hypothetical scenario, we'll assume the current time is 14Z (10:00 AM CDT). 

The time difference for Port Arthur TX would be approximately -4 hours (or 6:00 PM CDT), meaning the 50-kt wind probability has already peaked.

For Galveston TX, the time difference would be approximately +2 hours (or 10:00 AM CDT on the next day), meaning the 50-kt wind probability is expected to peak in about 2 hours.",72
