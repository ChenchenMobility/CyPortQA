"A nice challenge!

After analyzing the data, I found that the relevant information is contained in the last four columns (34, 50, and two blank columns). The probability values are encoded in these columns using a simple code: each ""X"" represents a probability of 0, while the numbers represent the percentage chance.

Specifically, for Port of Savannah, GA, I found:

* 34: 2
* Blank: (no data)
* 50: 6
* Blank: (no data)

So, the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Port of Savannah, GA within the next 5 days is **2 + 6 = 8**.
