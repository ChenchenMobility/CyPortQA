DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM EST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eta was
located near latitude 25.0 North, longitude 84.1 West. Eta is moving
toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h). A motion toward the
north-northeast is forecast through Thursday. On the forecast track
the center of Eta will move closer to but offshore of the southwest
coast of Florida today, approach the west-central coast of Florida
Wednesday night, and move inland over the northern portion of the
Florida peninsula on Thursday.  Eta is expected to move 
northeastward into the western Atlantic late Thursday or early 
Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Eta is expected to be near or at hurricane 
strength tonight as it approaches the west coast of Florida, with 
rapid weakening expected after landfall on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Eta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC, and on the
web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Steinhatchee River to Bonita Beach, FL including Tampa Bay and
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Flamingo, FL...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore flow, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
RAINFALL:  Eta is expected to produce the following rainfall totals:
 
Western Cuba: an additional 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm) on
Wednesday, with isolated maximum storm total accumulations of 25
inches (765 mm).
 
West Florida: through Friday, 2 to 4 inches, with maximum storm
total accumulations of 6 inches.
 
North and South Florida: an additional 1 to 2 inches, with isolated
maximum storm total accumulations of 4 inches in North Florida and
20 inches in South Florida.
 
Flash and river flooding will be possible in western Cuba on
Wednesday, along with landslides in areas of higher terrain.
Additional flash and urban flooding will be possible in South
Florida, especially across previously inundated areas.  Flash,urban,
and isolated minor river flooding is expected across portions of
West and North Florida through Friday.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible in the watch area by early
Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Dry Tortugas
through this morning. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the
Tropical Storm Warning area along the Florida west coast by
Wednesday afternoon.    Tropical Storm conditions are possible in
the watch area along the Florida Big Bend region by Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch
area in Cuba for the next few hours.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Eta are expected to affect the north
coast of Cuba, southern and western Florida, and the Florida Keys
during the next day or so.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
