"The image shows a forecast for Tropical Depression Harvey from the National Weather Service. It mentions that the storm is drifting erratically northwestward as a tropical depression and is moving toward the northwest at 2 mph (4 km/h). The advisory also states that Harvey is expected to approach the Texas coast late Friday or Friday night, with the possibility of becoming a hurricane.

The hazards affecting land include rainfall and storm surge. Rainfall totals of 10 to 15 inches are expected over the Texas coast and southwest Louisiana through next Wednesday, with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches. Storm surge is also expected, with the combination of a dangerous storm surge and tide causing normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.

It is not clear how many days the port's freight is expected to be affected by the storm based on this forecast. The image does not provide specific information about the duration of the storm or its impact on freight operations at the port.",7
