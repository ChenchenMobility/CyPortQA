DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Delta was located
near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 79.6 West. Delta is moving
toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A faster
northwestward motion is expected Tuesday through Wednesday night.  
On the forecast track, the center of Delta is expected to pass
southwest of the Cayman Islands early Tuesday, and approach the
northeastern portion of the Yucatan peninsula and the Yucatan
Channel Tuesday afternoon or evening.  Delta is forecast to move
over the southern Gulf of Mexico Tuesday night or early Wednesday,
and be over the south-central Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday and
Wednesday night.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional rapid strengthening is expected
during the next day or so, and Delta is expected to be a major
hurricane when it nears the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (25 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend up to 70 miles (110
km) from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from data provided by the
NOAA reconnaissance aircraft is 980 mb (28.94 inches).

Yucatan peninsula within the hurricane warning area, near and to
right of where the center makes landfall. Near the coast, the surge
will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.

later tonight.  Hurricane conditions are expected within the
hurricane warning area in the Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday night, with

conditions are possible on the Isle of Youth beginning Tuesday
afternoon with tropical storm conditions expected by early Tuesday.

area in Cuba on Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Through midweek, Delta is expected to produce 3 to 6
inches of rain with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches across
Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, western Cuba and the northern Yucatan
Peninsula. This rainfall could lead to significant flash floods and
mudslides.
 
Later this week into the weekend, Delta is expected to bring heavy
rainfall across portions of the central Gulf Coast into the
southeastern United States.
