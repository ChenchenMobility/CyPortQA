"Based on the image provided by you, I can see that there is a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico, and it has been named ""Hanna."" The current eye of the tropical cyclone is located at approximately '32.4N, 77.6W'.

"The image you've provided appears to be a track forecast cone for a tropical cyclone. However, it does not show the current location of the eye in terms of coordinates, such as '32.4N, 77.6W'. The cone shows the potential future path and intensity of the cyclone, but it is not meant to represent the current state of the cyclone.

To obtain the current position of a tropical cyclone, one would typically look at real-time weather maps, satellite imagery, or official forecasts from meteorological agencies such as the National Hurricane Center (NHC). These sources provide accurate and up-to-date information on the location, movement, and intensity of tropical cyclones.","27.1N, 92.8W"
