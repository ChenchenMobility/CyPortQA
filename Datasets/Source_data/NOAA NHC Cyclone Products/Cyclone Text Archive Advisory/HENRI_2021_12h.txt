DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Henri was located
near latitude 39.3 North, longitude 71.0 West. Henri is moving
toward the north near 21 mph (33 km/h).  A decrease in forward 
speed and a turn toward the north-northwest is expected later this 
morning. On the forecast track, Henri is expected to make landfall 
in southern New England or on Long Island today.  After landfall, a 
turn to the north and a slower forward speed are expected as Henri 
moves over southern New England.
 
Reports from Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Slight strengthening is possible early this morning. 
Weakening is expected to begin later today. However, Henri is 
expected to be at or near hurricane strength when it reaches the 
coasts of southern New England and Long island.  Rapid weakening is 
expected after Henri makes landfall.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from data from 
an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 987 mb (29.15 
inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Henri can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Flushing, NY to Chatham, MA including Narragansett Bay, Buzzards
Bay, Vineyard Sound, and Nantucket Sound...3-5 ft
North shore of Long Island from Flushing to Montauk Point, NY
including Long Island Sound...3-5 ft
South shore of Long Island from Mastic Beach to Montauk Point,
NY...3-5 ft
Chatham, MA to Sagamore Beach, MA including Cape Cod Bay...2-4 ft
South shore of Long Island from East Rockaway Inlet to Mastic Beach,
NY...2-4 ft
Cape May, NJ to East Rockaway Inlet, NY...1-3 ft
Sagamore Beach, MA to Merrimack River including Massachusetts
Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area today, with tropical storm conditions beginning within the 
next few hours.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the 
tropical storm warning area beginning this morning and continuing 
into tonight. 

RAINFALL:  Henri is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches over portions of Long Island, New England, southeast New
York, and New Jersey today into Monday, with isolated maximum
totals near 10 inches. Heavy rainfall from Henri may result in
considerable flash, urban, and small stream flooding, along with the
potential for widespread minor to isolated moderate river flooding.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two may occur today over southern 
New England.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Henri should continue to affect Bermuda
today.  Swells are expected to increase across much of the east 
coast of the U.S. and Atlantic Canada today and continue into 
Monday.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
