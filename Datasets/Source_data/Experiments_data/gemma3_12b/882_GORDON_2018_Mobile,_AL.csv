"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Reasoning:**

*   **Storm Impact:** The forecast details significant risks (hurricane and tropical storm conditions, heavy rainfall, and surge) over Mobile, AL.
*   **Shipping:** Mobile is a major port. A storm of this magnitude would likely cause port closures and suspensions of shipping.
*   **Port Safety:** To ensure the safety of the crew, cargo, and vessels, authorities and shipping companies would restrict the port.
*   **Given time period:** The storm's impacts last for at least 12-18 hours or more. More than 20 vessels may be affected or impacted by the storm over that period of time.

Since the storm includes warnings for storm surge, high winds, and flooding. This will result in a high number of ships impacted.",C.
