I cannot provide information on future events or scenarios.,Elevated rip-current risk along Maryland and Delaware beaches; lowered ceilings and visibility may disrupt flight operations at nearby airports.
Additional hazards include potential flooding and power outages caused by heavy rainfall.,Elevated waves and rip-current risk along the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic beaches could affect vessel traffic and pilot operations.
Flooding due to storm surges from Ana,Increased rip-current risk at nearby Atlantic beaches; slight coastal flooding at high tide.
"The possible future storm may bring flooding risks to Baltimore, MD due to the combination of heavy rainfall and storm tide surges.",Enhanced rip currents and minor coastal/Chesapeake Bay flooding possible during high tide cycles
"The image you've provided is a map of a tropical storm named Ana. In addition to the typical storm-related hazards such as heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surge, there are no additional hazards visible on this map that would specifically impact Baltimore, MD.",Dangerous rip currents along nearby Atlantic beaches; reduced visibility in heavy rain could disrupt vessel movements
