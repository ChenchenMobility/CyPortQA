DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Henri was 
located near latitude 29.5 North, longitude 70.5 West. Henri is 
moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the northwest 
is forecast on Friday, followed by an acceleration toward the north 
and north-northeast Saturday and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Henri will remain well offshore of the east coast of the 
United States over the next couple of days, but it is forecast to be 
near southern New England on Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected today, but Henri is 
forecast to intensify into a hurricane on Friday with additional 
strengthening predicted to occur this weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Henri should continue to affect Bermuda
during the next day or so.  Swells are expected to increase across
much of the east coast of the U.S. and Atlantic Canada later this
week and this weekend.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
