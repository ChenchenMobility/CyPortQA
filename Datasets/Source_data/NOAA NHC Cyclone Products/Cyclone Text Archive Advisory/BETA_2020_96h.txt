At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Twenty-Two was located near latitude 22.0 North, longitude 94.2
West.  The depression is moving toward the northeast near 3 mph (6
km/h).  A slow north-northeastward motion is expected through early
Saturday, with a slow turn toward the north and then west 
anticipated over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and the 
depression is expected to become a tropical storm on Friday.  The 
system could be near or at hurricane strength by Sunday.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells are expected to increase and reach the coast of Texas
and the Gulf coast of Mexico over the weekend, generated by a
combination of the depression and a cold front entering the 
northern Gulf of Mexico.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
