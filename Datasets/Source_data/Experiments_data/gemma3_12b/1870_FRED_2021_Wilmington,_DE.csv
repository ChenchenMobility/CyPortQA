Okay. 2.

Okay. with.
The forecast table and. 
Okay. of.124.1.7.1.4.

Let's break down the scenario and address your question regarding port operations based on the provided data.

**Understanding the Data**

*   **Track Forecast Cone:** Shows the likely path of the center of the storm. It's essential for determining which areas are most likely to be impacted directly.
*   **Wind Probability Forecast Graphic:** This shows the probability of experiencing tropical storm force winds (39 mph+) within a particular area. This is *extremely* important for port operations, as even below-hurricane winds can significantly disrupt shipping and terminal activity.
*   **Future Wind Probability Table:** Provides a more detailed, hour-by-hour look at the probability of various wind speeds at specific locations.
*   **Cyclone Public Advisory:** The official update from the National Hurricane Center, providing the storm's current status, forecast track, and potential hazards.

**Analysis and Port Operations Implications**

1.  **Storm Track and Initial Impact:**
    *   The storm is initially tracking across the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Currently, Cuba is experiencing impacts, and now southeastern Florida is moving into the cone of uncertainty.
    *   Port operations in Havana, Cuba would already be significantly disrupted, and potentially halted.
    *   The Gulf Coast of the US (Alabama, Mississippi, Florida) are now moving into the region of increased threat.

2.  **Wind Impacts - Key Locations**

Let's extract data from the provided information and relate it to the potential impact on key locations. I'll focus on:

*   **Mobile, AL:** Critical port for bulk cargo.
*   **Pensacola, FL:** Significant port for container and bulk cargo.
*   **Tampa, FL:** Major container port.

**Mobile, Alabama:**

*   **Wind Probability:** The Wind Probability Table shows a high probability of tropical storm force winds (39mph+) starting late Sunday. The chance of 64 mph+ winds increases significantly Monday.
*   **Operational Impact:**
    *   **Late Sunday:** Expect delays in vessel arrivals and departures. Restrictions on cargo movement within the terminal may be implemented due to safety concerns.
    *   **Monday:** **High likelihood of port closure.** Sustained winds of 39-54mph or higher would make it unsafe for terminal operations. All vessel traffic would be suspended.
    *   **Post-Storm:** Significant cleanup and inspection would be required before port operations can resume.

**Pensacola, FL**

*   **Wind Probability:** Similar to Mobile, Pensacola is expected to experience high probabilities of tropical storm-force winds.
*   **Operational Impact:** Expect the same progression of delays, restrictions, and potential closure outlined for Mobile.

**Tampa, FL**

*   **Wind Probability:** The probabilities are similar to Mobile and Pensacola, with the chance of strong winds starting on Monday.
*   **Operational Impact:** The same progression of impacts - delays, restrictions, potential closure - applies here.

**Summary Table:**

| Location     | Sunday Late | Monday | Key Operational Impacts                               |
|--------------|-------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Mobile, AL   | Delays/Restr.|Closure| Significant Disruption – Potential Closure             |
| Pensacola, FL| Delays/Restr.|Closure| Significant Disruption – Potential Closure             |
| Tampa, FL     | Delays/Restr.|Closure| Significant Disruption – Potential Closure             |

**Key Recommendations for Port Operators**

1.  **Activate Emergency Plans:**  Immediately execute the port’s hurricane response plan.
2.  **Secure Cargo:** Ensure all cargo is properly secured to prevent shifting or damage.
3.  **Vessel Management:** Contact vessels scheduled to arrive or depart and advise of potential delays or cancellations.
4.  **Terminal Shutdown:** Prepare for potential terminal closure as early as Sunday evening, following instructions from local authorities.
5.  **Personnel Safety:** Prioritize the safety of port personnel.  Ensure evacuation plans are in place and followed.
6.  **Monitor Conditions:** Stay closely updated on the storm's progress via the National Hurricane Center and local weather reports.
7.  **Post-Storm Assessment:** After the storm passes, conduct a thorough assessment of the port’s infrastructure and equipment before resuming operations.
8.  **Communication:** Keep stakeholders informed (shippers, truckers, etc.) about the situation and any disruptions.



**Important Note:**  This analysis is based on the provided data, which can change. It's critical to constantly monitor the latest forecasts and heed the advice of local authorities. The timeline and severity of impacts are dependent on the storm's actual track and intensity.",0

**Explanation:**

Here's why:

*   **Focus of the Report:** The report details the path and impacts of Tropical Storm Fred across the Caribbean, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Turks and Caicos, Bahamas, and Cuba. It mentions potential impacts on Florida and the Southeast U.S. but doesn't specifically address Wilmington, DE, or its port activity.
*   **No Mention of Wilmington:** There's no mention of Wilmington, DE, or its port in the text. Therefore, the report doesn't provide any data to indicate commercial vessel impacts there.
*   **Average Daily Vessels:** The information about the average daily vessel count (3.683602069) is irrelevant to the question if there's no indication of impacts from the storm.",A.
