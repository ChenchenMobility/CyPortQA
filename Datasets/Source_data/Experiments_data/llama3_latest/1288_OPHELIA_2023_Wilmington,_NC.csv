B. 10-20 vessels,A.
"Based on the information provided, there is no specific data on commercial vessels affected by the storm at Wilmington, NC. However, we can estimate the impact based on the predicted wind and surge impacts.

The storm's strongest winds are expected to occur along the coast of North Carolina, with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 240 miles from the center. Since Wilmington is located near the coastline, it will likely experience strong winds.

In terms of surge, the prediction suggests that Wilmington could see a surge of around 1-3 feet above ground, which may cause some disruption to coastal operations and potentially affect commercial vessels.

Given these factors, we can estimate the impact on commercial vessels as follows:

* None: This is unlikely, as even with a relatively low surge height, some commercial vessels may still be affected by strong winds or rough seas.
* 1-10 vessels: This is possible, as the storm's wind and surge impacts could cause some disruptions to operations at Wilmington. However, the number of affected vessels would likely depend on various factors such as vessel type, size, and anchoring location.
* 10-20 vessels: This is a more likely scenario, given the predicted storm conditions and the potential for some commercial vessels to be affected.

Based on these estimates, I recommend:

D. 20 vessels or more",A.
D. 20 vessels or more,A.
The answer is D. 20 vessels or more.,A.
