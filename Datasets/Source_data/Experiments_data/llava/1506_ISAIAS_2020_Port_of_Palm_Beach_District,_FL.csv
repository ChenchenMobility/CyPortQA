Note: The gale force probability (34kt) refers to the likelihood of wind speeds exceeding 34 kt (38 mph or 61 km/h) in the next 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Based on the information provided in the bulletin, the storm is expected to be a tropical storm, which typically has wind speeds ranging from 34 to 74 kt (38 to 87 mph or 61 to 140 km/h). Therefore, it can be concluded that there will be no gale force winds in the next 12 hours. However, gale force winds are possible in the next 48, 72, and 96 hours as the storm is expected to strengthen and move over the Bahamas and towards the southeastern United States.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '8%', 'in 72h': '40%', 'in 96h': '46%'}"

Tropical storm warnings are typically issued for 48 hours before they are upgraded or downgraded to watches or advisories. As the bulletin was issued at 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the impact of Isaias on freight at Port of Palm Beach District, FL might continue until at least 1200 UTC (7:00 PM EDT) on July 30th.

It's important to note that the exact end date may vary depending on the storm's path and intensity, as well as any changes in the forecast track or wind patterns. It's always best to monitor local weather updates for the most current information.",7/31/2020 0:00
