Looking at the image, I can see a large storm system with several concentric circles around it, indicating different forecast models. The most recent position of the storm appears to be marked by a red circle on the map, which is typical for representing the current location and direction of a tropical cyclone.

However, without access to current weather data or real-time tracking information, I am unable to provide the exact coordinates of the eye of the storm at this moment.

"The image you've provided appears to show a track map for a tropical storm or hurricane named Matthew. The storm is currently located near latitude 21.8 North and longitude 75.2 West, which corresponds to the southeastern Bahamas. It is moving towards the northwest at about 12 mph (19 km/h), and is expected to be a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The forecast suggests that Matthew will move across the Bahamas through Thursday and be very near the east coast of Florida by Thursday evening.

The map also shows various watches and warnings in effect for different regions, including a Hurricane Warning for parts of Cuba, the southeastern Bahamas, and a part of the Florida Keys and coast. There is also a Tropical Storm Watch for other areas. The hazards affected include wind, rainfall, storm surge, and surf.

The expected end of impact on freight at San Juan, PR would depend on the specific path and intensity of the storm as it approaches or passes through the Caribbean and then moves towards the eastern coast of the United States. As the forecast suggests that Matthew will move across the Bahamas through Thursday and be very near the east coast of Florida by Thursday evening, it is likely that San Juan could experience some impact from the storm within a week to ten days after this forecast was issued. However, since the storm's track and intensity can change over time, the exact date for the end of impact on freight at San Juan cannot be determined with certainty from this image alone.",9/29/2016 0:00
