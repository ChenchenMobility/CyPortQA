"The image you provided is the Tropical Cyclone Public Advisory from National Hurricane Center for Tropical Depression Fourteen. According to this advisory, Galveston, TX is expected to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions by tonight.

The advisory provides information about the current location and movement of the depression, as well as its forecast track and intensity. It also lists watches and warnings in effect, which include Tropical Storm Warnings for Honduras/Nicaragua border westward to Punta Castilla Honduras, the Bay Islands of Honduras, and Puerto Cabezas Nicaragua northward to the Honduras/Nicaragua border.

The advisory also includes a discussion on the outlook for the depression, noting that it is expected to become a tropical storm tonight and could be near or at hurricane strength when it reaches the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico late Saturday. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

The advisory also discusses potential hazards affecting land, including wind and rainfall. It notes that tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the warning area by tonight, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous. The depression is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rainfall in eastern portions of the Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucatan, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches. Honduras may experience 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, while Jamaica and northern Nicaragua may see 1 to 2 inches.

The next intermediate advisory is expected at 800 PM EDT, and the next complete advisory will be issued at 1100 PM EDT. The advisory was prepared by Forecaster Berg.",120

This JSON object represents the probability of gale force winds (34kt) occurring at different time intervals in the future. The Galley Force Probability is a measure of how likely it is that gale force winds will be present in a given location and at a given time. The Confidence Level represents the level of certainty associated with the Galley Force Probability, ranging from 20% to 100%.

In this scenario, the probability of gale force winds increases over time, starting at 50% for the next 12 hours and reaching 100% for the following 96 hours. The confidence level also increases over time, with the highest level of confidence being 100% for the last two time intervals. This suggests that as we look further into the future, there is a higher degree of certainty that gale force winds will be present in the area.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '3%'}"
