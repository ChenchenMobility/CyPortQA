Port Everglades is located in Broward County, Florida. The closest listed locations in the data are Fort Lauderdale and Miami, Florida. We will use the probabilities from these locations to estimate the cumulative probability for Port Everglades.

From the data:
- Fort Lauderdale (50-kt winds): 24, 2, 2 (cumulative probability over 5 days)
- Miami (50-kt winds): 25, 5, 3 (cumulative probability over 5 days)

To estimate the cumulative probability for Port Everglades, we can average the probabilities from Fort Lauderdale and Miami:

(24 + 25) / 2 = 24.5
