"The image provided appears to be a screenshot of the National Hurricane Center's advisory for Tropical Depression Nine. According to the advisory, as of 5:00 AM AST (09:00 UTC) on September 23, 2022, the center of Tropical Depression Nine was located near latitude 13.9 North, longitude 68.6 West, and was moving toward the west-northwest at a speed of 13 mph (20 km/h). The maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.

The advisory also indicated that a turn more westward is forecast over the next day or so, followed by a turn back to the west-northwest and northwest by this weekend. Additionally, it mentioned that maximum sustained winds are expected to be near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts, and that some slow intensification is forecast over the next day or so, followed by more significant intensification over the weekend and early next week.

In terms of hazards affecting land, the advisory states that Tropical Depression Nine is expected to produce rainfall across various areas including Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao; Northern Venezuela; Northern Colombia; Jamaica; the Cayman Islands; Southern Haiti and Southern Dominican Republic; and potentially Port Everglades, FL. The advisory also mentions that swells generated by this system will begin affecting Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Cuba over the next several days, and may cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

Without additional information or context, it is not possible to determine when Port Everglades, FL is most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions based on the image provided.",120
