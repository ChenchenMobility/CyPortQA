In this JSON, the gale force probability (34kt) for each time period is shown. For the next 12 hours, there is a 0-10% chance of gale force winds, which means it is unlikely. However, for the subsequent time periods, there is an increasing chance of gale force winds, with a higher probability at 48 hours and beyond. This suggests that as time progresses, the likelihood of gale force winds increases, but it is still uncertain whether they will actually occur.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '18%', 'in 96h': '24%'}"
