"I'm unable to directly answer your question as an AI assistant; however, I can provide guidance on how to analyze the image you provided.

To determine the current eye of the tropical cyclone in the image, you should look for the area with the highest wind speeds and a well-defined center. This is typically represented by a color scale that indicates wind intensity. The eye is usually a small and relatively calm area at the center of the storm, surrounded by the strongest winds of the cyclone.

Looking at the image you've provided, I can guide you to identify the current eye:
1. Pay attention to the color scale, which represents wind speed (often given in knots or other units).
2. Look for an area with a higher concentration of colors that correspond to stronger winds.
3. Search for an area with a well-defined center and a calm appearance compared to the surrounding areas.

Once you have identified these characteristics, you can determine the current eye's coordinates (latitude and longitude). Remember to use a reliable source or consult an expert in meteorology if needed.","16.4N, 78.4W"

"The freight at the port is not directly affected by the storm. The storm itself will make it unsafe and challenging to operate, but that would typically affect cargo flow rather than specifically the freight itself. If you are asking about when the freight may be delayed or impacted due to the storm, that would depend on how the storm affects the port's operations and the severity of the storm. It is not possible to provide an answer without more context.",3
