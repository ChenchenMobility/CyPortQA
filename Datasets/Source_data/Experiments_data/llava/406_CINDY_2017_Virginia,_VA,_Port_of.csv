------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cindy was located near latitude 27.3 North, longitude 91.9 West. Cindy is moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this motion is expected to continue today. A turn toward the north-northwest and then toward the north is expected tonight and early Thursday. On the forecast track, the center of Cindy will approach the coast of southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas late today or tonight, and move inland over southeastern Texas or southwestern Louisiana on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected today. Slight weakening is forecast to begin on Thursday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km), mainly north through northeast of the center.
