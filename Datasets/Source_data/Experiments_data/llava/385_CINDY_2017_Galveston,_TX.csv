"The image shows an advisory from the National Hurricane Center about Tropical Storm Cindy. The storm is located near latitude 25.7 North, longitude 90.6 West, and is expected to approach the coast of southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas later Wednesday and Wednesday night. The center of Cindy will move inland over southeastern Texas on Thursday. Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Some slight strengthening is expected during the next 24 hours. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) from the center, mainly to the north and east of the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches). Rainfall amounts of 6 to 9 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches over southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle through Thursday are expected, which could cause life-threatening flash flooding in these areas. Rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches can be expected farther west across southwest Louisiana into southeast Texas through Thursday. Inundation of 1 to 3 feet above ground level is possible along the coast in portions of the Tropical Storm Warning area. Isolated tornadoes are also possible this evening and tonight from south-central Louisiana to the western Florida Panhandle. The next advisory is expected at 700 PM CDT, and the next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.
