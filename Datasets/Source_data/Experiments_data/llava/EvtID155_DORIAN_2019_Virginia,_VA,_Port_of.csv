"There seems to be an error in your question. You mentioned ""when is the expected end of impact on freight at Virginia, VA, Port of?"" but you did not specify which port in Virginia you are referring to. Additionally, as a language model, I do not have access to current weather information or forecasts. My knowledge is based on the data available up until 2021 and does not include real-time updates. However, in general, if you are asking about when a hurricane or other storm system will no longer impact freight at Virginia's ports, it would typically depend on the track of the storm and how long it takes for the storm to pass over the area. Once the storm has moved further away from the coast, its impacts on port operations should decrease. It is important to monitor local weather forecasts and updates from the National Weather Service or other reliable sources for the most accurate and up-to-date information about a storm's potential impact on your location.",9/2/2019
"The expected end of impact on freight at Virginia, VA, Port of depends on the track and intensity of Hurricane Dorian. If Dorian follows the current forecast and makes landfall along the coast of North Carolina on Thursday night or Friday, the impact on freight could last several days as recovery operations take place. Therefore, without a more accurate forecast, it is not possible to provide an exact date for when the expected end of impact on freight will be at the Port of Virginia.",9/2/2019

"The image you provided appears to be a screenshot of a weather advisory from the National Weather Service (NWS). Based on the information in the advisory, it seems that the impact of Hurricane Dorian on freight at the Port of Virginia may continue for several days. The advisory mentions that tropical storm conditions are expected within the Tropical Storm Warning area along the coast of northeastern Florida and Georgia on Wednesday, and that water levels could begin to rise well in advance of the arrival of strong winds. It also states that large and destructive waves will accompany the surge, which may cause damage to infrastructure and pose a threat to life and property.

Without more information about the specific impact of the storm on freight operations at the Port of Virginia, it is difficult to provide an exact date for when the end of impact will be expected. However, given the timing of the tropical storm conditions mentioned in the advisory, it appears that the impact may continue through Wednesday and possibly into Thursday. It is important for anyone involved in freight operations at the Port of Virginia to closely monitor weather updates from NWS and follow any instructions provided by local officials to ensure safety and minimize disruptions to operations.",9/2/2019

"Based on the information provided in the image, it appears that Dorian will make landfall as a hurricane near Cape Fear, North Carolina within 36 hours from the time of this bulletin (800 PM EDT). Therefore, if the storm's impact is felt for 3 days after making landfall (for example, on Monday and Tuesday), it would be affected by the storm. However, without more information about the duration and intensity of the storm, it is difficult to provide an exact number of days that the port's freight may be affected by the storm.",2

"Based on the information provided and assuming all commercial vessels in Virginia are affected during the entire event, we can calculate the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels as follows:

Total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels = Total number of vessels \* Impacted time period
= 17.58411926 \* 3 days (assuming Dorian affects Virginia for 3 consecutive days)
= 52.7523586 days

However, since the text provided suggests that Dorian is expected to produce the following rainfall totals through Friday:

Northwestern Bahamas...Additional 1 to 3 inches, isolated storm totals over 30 inches.
Coastal Carolinas...5 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches.
Atlantic Coast from the Florida peninsula north of West Palm Beach through Georgia and across southeast Virginia...3 to 6 inches

It is likely that Dorian will not affect Virginia for 3 consecutive days, and it is also possible that the impacted number of commercial vessels in Virginia could be affected more than once during the event. Therefore, we cannot confidently determine the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Virginia, VA, Port of over the entire event, where the average number of vessels daily is 17.58411926.
