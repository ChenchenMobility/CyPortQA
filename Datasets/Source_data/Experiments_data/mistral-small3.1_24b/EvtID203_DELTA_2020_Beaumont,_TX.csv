"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for Beaumont, TX, we need to locate Beaumont, TX in the provided data. Since Beaumont, TX is not explicitly listed, we can refer to nearby locations such as Port Arthur, TX, or High Island, TX, which are geographically close and likely to have similar wind probability data.

Looking at Port Arthur, TX:
- 0-12 hours: X
- 12-24 hours: X
- 24-48 hours: 5
- 48 hours or more: 26

Looking at High Island, TX:
- 0-12 hours: X
- 12-24 hours: X
- 24-48 hours: 6
- 48 hours or more: 22

Both Port Arthur, TX, and High Island, TX, show the highest 34-kt wind probability in the interval of 48 hours or more.
