For example, Gulfport MS (34-kt probability: 6) and Pascagoula MS (34-kt probability: 7) can be used as proxies. Since the data for Pascagoula is not provided, you might use the value for Gulfport MS as an estimate.

Then, sum the probabilities listed under the ""50"" column for Pascagoula, MS.

"The table provided does not include specific data for the Port of Pascagoula, MS. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for that location based on the given information.",B.
"The data provided does not include a specific entry for the Port of Pascagoula, MS. However, based on the closest available location, which is Buras, LA (as it is geographically close to Pascagoula, MS), we can infer the highest 34-kt wind probability.

For Buras, LA:

- 0-12 hours: 1
- 12-24 hours: 3
- 24-48 hours: 1
- 48 hours or more: 1

Given the above probabilities, the highest 34-kt wind probability for Buras, LA (and by inference for Port of Pascagoula, MS is in the 12-24 hour interval.

So the answer is: B. 12-24 Hours",C.

"The table provided does not include specific data for the Port of Pascagoula, MS. However, based on the available data, we can infer information from nearby locations such as Gulfport, MS, and Buras, LA, and Stennis, MS. These locations provide a general idea of the timing for the probability of 34-kt winds.

Given the information from nearby locations, the first time the probability of 34-kt winds rises above zero is typically within the 0-24 hour range.
