"The image shows a map and a graphical representation of a storm track forecast cone. There are notations and annotations on the image providing information about the storm's path, intensity, and other meteorological details.

To answer your question based on the map provided in the image:

The current eye of the tropical cyclone is located at 32.4N, 77.6W. This corresponds to the coordinates of the center where the storm is strongest. The eye of a hurricane is typically characterized by low pressure and relatively calm weather conditions compared to the surrounding storm systems. It's important to note that the forecast cone indicates possible paths of the storm over time, but the current eye is at the specified coordinates.","27.7N, 86.6W"
"The image shows a map from the National Hurricane Center, with a tropical cyclone named Michael in progress. The most recent track forecast cone for Michael is overlayed on the map, and it includes the current position of the center of the storm. According to the image, the current eye of the tropical cyclone is located at '32.4N, 77.6W'.","25.4N, 86.4W"
"The image shows a forecast cone from the National Hurricane Center, indicating the possible track of a tropical cyclone.

The image does not provide the current eye of the tropical cyclone's coordinates. It only shows the cone of potential tracks.,"21.7N, 85.1W"
"The current eye of the tropical cyclone is at '28.0N, 58.0W'.","20.1N, 85.5W"
"The image does not provide the exact coordinates of the current eye of the tropical cyclone. However, it does show a cone of possible tracks from the National Hurricane Center, indicating that the eye is likely within this cone.","19.2N, 86.9W"
"The image does not provide the exact coordinates of the current eye of the tropical cyclone in the form of latitude and longitude. However, it appears to show a storm with the path indicated by the track forecast cone from National Hurricane Center. It's important for the accuracy of this information that the latest updates are followed for any potential impact or changes in the track and intensity of the tropical cyclone.","18.4N, 87.1W"
