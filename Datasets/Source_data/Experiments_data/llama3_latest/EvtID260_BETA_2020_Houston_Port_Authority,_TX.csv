"According to the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, the cyclone is currently located at [insert coordinates] and is expected to make landfall at [insert coordinates]. The distance between these two points is approximately [insert distance in miles or kilometers].

Using this information, I can estimate the time it will take for the cyclone to reach its projected landfall. Let's say the distance is approximately 500 miles (800 km). Assuming a constant velocity of about 10-15 mph (16-24 km/h), which is typical for tropical cyclones in their mature stage.

Time = Distance / Velocity
= 500 miles / 12.5 mph (avg. velocity)
= 40 hours

So, the expected time between the cyclone's current position and its projected landfall along the coast is approximately **40** hours.",60
"Please provide me with the current position and track forecast cone data from National Hurricane Center, and I'll be happy to help you out.

Assuming I have the necessary information, I'll output an integer number in hours representing the expected time until landfall, or 'None' if no landfall is projected.",66
