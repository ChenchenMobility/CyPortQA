"The text does not provide enough information to determine the exact time when PortMiami, FL will begin experiencing tropical storm conditions. It only states that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area by late Monday night or Tuesday morning. Therefore, the answer is 0.",36
"The image shows that the remnants of Fred are currently near latitude 24.0 North, longitude 84.6 West and moving west-northwest at 13 mph (20 km/h). It is forecast to cross the southeastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and move inland along the northern Gulf coast Monday night. The maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1012 mb (29.89 inches). The image also shows that rainfall amounts through today range from 2 to 5 inches in portions of Cuba, and from Sunday night into Tuesday in the Florida Big Bend and Panhandle.

Therefore, PortMiami, FL is most likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions on Monday night when the remnants of Fred are expected to move inland along the northern Gulf coast.",54
