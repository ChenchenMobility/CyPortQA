The map includes various meteorological data such as wind speeds, projected track areas, and other information related to the storm's movement and conditions. It also shows the location of a hurricane center.

Please note that the most current information on the exact position of the eye of a tropical cyclone would typically be available from official meteorological services such as the National Weather Service or the National Hurricane Center, which provide updates and forecasts based on real-time data and models.","26.2N, 87.0W"
