"A weather enthusiast!

According to the text, I'll extract the relevant information:

For Port of Brunswick, GA (location: BSN):

* Time: 34
* Wind speed: 50 kt
* Probability: not specified

Since the time is 34, it's likely referring to hours. To find out how many hours remain until the 50-kt wind probability peaks within the next 5 days, I'll assume that the peak will occur within the next 3 days (since there are only 2 hours left at present).

Now, let's do some simple math:

Let's say the current time is 0 hours. If we add the remaining hours to reach the 34th hour, that would be:
34 - 2 = 32 hours

So, approximately **32 hours** remain until the 50-kt wind probability peaks at Port of Brunswick, GA within the next 5 days.",30
