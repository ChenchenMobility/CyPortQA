In general, the eye is typically located at the center of a tropical cyclone, which can be predicted by various meteorological models. If you need information about the current position of the storm's eye, I would recommend checking the latest advisories or warnings issued by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for updated information on the track and intensity of the storm.","19.6N, 92.0W"

"The probability for 34-kt winds at Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA within the next 5 days is 1( 1) and it peaks at 00Z Fri, which means there are 50 hours remaining until the 34-kt wind probability peaks.",120
"The probability of sustained 34-knot winds (39 mph or 63 km/h) at Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA within the next 5 days begins to peak at 12Z on Wednesday, June 03, which corresponds to an NNWN (National Weather Service Watch and Warning Number) for tropical storm conditions. The cumulative probability of a 34-knot wind event occurring between 12Z Tue and the forecast hour is greater than or equal to 3 percent.

To find out how many hours remain until the 34-kt wind probability peaks, we need to identify the time period within the next 5 days when the cumulative probability of a 34-knot wind event occurring between 12Z Tue and the forecast hour is greater than or equal to 3 percent.

We can see that at Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA, the cumulative probability for a 34-knot wind event begins to peak at 12Z on Wednesday, June 03. So, we need to find out how many hours remain until 12Z on Wednesday, June 03.

From the NWS Tropical Prediction Center (TPCO) forecast, the time period for the 34-knot wind probability peaks at Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA is between 12Z on Tuesday, June 02 and 12Z on Wednesday, June 03.

Therefore, we need to find out how many hours remain until 12Z on Tuesday, June 02. We know that at 1500 UTC (which is the same as GMT) on Tuesday, June 02, the 34-knot wind probability begins to rise for Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA.

We need to convert the time period (from 1500 UTC on Tuesday, June 02 to 12Z on Wednesday, June 03) into hours. There are 72 hours in a day, so the time period is approximately:

(12Z - 1500 UTC)/72 hours = 19.7 hours

Therefore, there are approximately 19.7 hours remaining until the 34-kt wind probability peaks at Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA within the next 5 days.",120
