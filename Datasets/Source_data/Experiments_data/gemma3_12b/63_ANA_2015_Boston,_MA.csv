"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Timeframe:** The advisory covers a period from 12Z Sat to 12Z Wed, which is roughly 5 days.
*   **Impact:** The advisory indicates that Boston, MA, will experience tropical storm conditions. This suggests a disruption to maritime activities.
*   **Average Vessels:** The daily average number of vessels is 3.939762702.
*   **Disruption:** Given the disruption caused by the storm, it's likely that the number of vessels will be significantly reduced. However, not all vessels will be affected. Considering the duration of the event, it is most likely that 10-20 vessels will experience some level of impact.

Therefore, the answer is **C. 10-20 vessels**.",C.
