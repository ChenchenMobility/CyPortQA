"The given data does not provide the cumulative probability for 34-kt wind arrival at New Orleans, LA. However, we can determine the onset probability and the 5-day cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival based on the National Hurricane Center's wind speed probability table.

From the table, the onset probability for 34-kt wind arrival at New Orleans, LA within the next 5 days is 7%. To find the 5-day cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at New Orleans, LA, we can multiply the onset probability by the number of days in the forecast period.

Since there are 5 days in the forecast period, the 5-day cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at New Orleans, LA would be:

7% (onset probability) \* 5 (days in the forecast period) = 35%

Therefore, the 5-day cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at New Orleans, LA within the next 5 days is 35%.",0%

However, it is clear that Tropical Storm Fay is currently affecting the coastal regions of the Delmarva Peninsula and the mid-Atlantic coast, with possible impacts on New Orleans in the future.",None
"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the exact start date for the expected impact on freight at New Orleans, LA. However, since the storm is expected to move inland over the northeast United States on Saturday, it could be assumed that the impact on freight may begin around that time.",None
"There is no specific mention of the peak impact on freight at New Orleans in this bulletin. The forecast track suggests that the center of Fay will move near the mid-Atlantic coast today and move inland over the mid-Atlantic or the northeast United States late tonight or on Saturday. It's not clear when the peak impact on freight would occur at New Orleans, as it depends on the track and intensity of the storm, which can change as Fay moves northward.",None
"There is no specific date given for the predicted peak impact on freight at New Orleans, LA in the provided forecast. The text only mentions that the storm is expected to bring heavy rainfall and gusty winds to portions of the mid-Atlantic coast and southern New England, and it will affect the warning area within 36 hours.

"As an astute observer, I am unable to predict specific dates and events with certainty. However, I can provide you with general information about the forecasted track of Tropical Storm Fay and its potential impact on freight at New Orleans, LA.

According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) advisory from 09-JUL-2020, Tropical Storm Fay is expected to move near the mid-Atlantic coast on Friday, July 10, and move inland over the northeast United States on Saturday, July 11. The storm may bring heavy rainfall and gusty winds to portions of the mid-Atlantic coast and southern New England.

New Orleans, LA is located near the Gulf of Mexico, which could be affected by a separate tropical system, rather than Tropical Storm Fay. Therefore, it is not explicitly stated in the advisory that freight at New Orleans will be impacted by Fay. Nonetheless, as a coastal city, New Orleans could experience some indirect impacts from the storm, such as disruptions to transportation and logistics networks or port closures due to inclement weather.

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information about any potential impacts of Tropical Storm Fay on freight at New Orleans, LA, it is advisable to monitor local news outlets and official announcements from relevant authorities in the city.",None
