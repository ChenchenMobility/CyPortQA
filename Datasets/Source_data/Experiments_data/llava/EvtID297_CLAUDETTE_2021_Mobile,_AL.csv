"The image shows a table listing wind speed probabilities for various locations and periods, including potential tropical cyclone three. It indicates that there is a 1% chance of sustained winds of at least 34 kts (39 mph) at Mobile, AL within the next 5 days. Since the probability peaks at 2 hours before onset, we can infer that it would be around 2 hours before the cyclone reaches the 34-kt wind threshold at Mobile, AL. However, since this is a prediction based on the given data and there are many factors that can influence weather conditions, it's important to note that this answer should not be considered as an exact number of hours remaining until the wind probability peaks at Mobile, AL.",72
