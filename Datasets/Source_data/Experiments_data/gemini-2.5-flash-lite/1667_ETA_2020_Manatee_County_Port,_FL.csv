"*   Manatee County Port, FL is currently within the Storm Surge Warning area for Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, with an expected surge of 3-5 feet. Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue through tonight.
*   Given the current conditions and forecast, it is advisable to suspend all general vessel operations until the storm has passed and conditions are deemed safe by port authorities.",All vessel movements within the port are prohibited and the port is closed to traffic.
"* **Manatee County Port, FL is currently under a Tropical Storm Warning, indicating that tropical storm conditions are expected within the next 6-12 hours.** Given the track forecast and wind probabilities, this suggests that operations should be suspended and vessels should seek safe harbor.
* **The Storm Surge Warning for Tampa Bay, which includes Manatee County, indicates a danger of life-threatening inundation from rising water.** This further reinforces the need to cease all port operations and ensure the safety of all personnel and vessels.",All vessel movements within the port are prohibited and the port is closed to traffic.
"* Manatee County Port, FL is currently under a Storm Surge Warning and Tropical Storm Warning. Operations should be suspended due to the expectation of tropical-storm-force winds within the next 6-12 hours, in addition to the danger of life-threatening inundation from storm surge.
* Given the current position of Hurricane Eta and its forecast track, there is a high probability (over 90%) of tropical-storm-force winds reaching Manatee County Port within the next 12-24 hours, necessitating immediate operational shutdown and securing of all port assets.",Port facilities are closed; cargo operations are suspended and facilities must secure equipment and prepare for hurricane-force winds.
"* Vessel operations at Manatee County Port, FL should anticipate significant disruptions due to Tropical Storm Eta. There is a 51% chance of tropical storm-force winds (39+ mph) by 12 hours from 7 PM EST Tuesday (approximately 7 AM EST Wednesday).
* Given the increasing wind probabilities and the projected track of Eta towards the Florida west coast, port operations should prepare for a potential cessation of all non-essential activities and the initiation of preparations for hurricane conditions if the storm continues to intensify.",All vessel movements within the port are prohibited and the port is closed to traffic.
"* Vessel activity at Manatee County Port, FL may be impacted by tropical storm conditions within the next 24 hours as Eta is forecast to move near or over Apalachee Bay by Thursday night.
* There is a 4-7% probability of sustained tropical storm force winds at the port within the next 24 hours.",All vessel movements within the port are prohibited and the port is closed to traffic.
"*   At 36 hours into the forecast (00Z Wed), Manatee County Port, FL, which is located in the vicinity of Venice, FL, has a 22% probability of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds (34-39 mph).
*   Given this probability, general vessel activity may need to be curtailed or suspended depending on the port's specific operational wind thresholds and risk tolerance.",All vessel movements within the port are prohibited and the port is closed to traffic.
"*   Based on the wind probability table, Manatee County Port, FL has a less than 1% chance of experiencing tropical storm-force winds (34 kt) within the next 48 hours.
*   This suggests that general vessel activity at Manatee County Port is unlikely to be significantly impacted by Tropical Storm Eta within the next 48 hours, and operations can likely continue as normal.",All vessel movements within the port are prohibited and the port is closed to traffic.
"At 60 hours into the forecast (approximately Friday 7 PM EST), Manatee County Port, FL is expected to experience a low probability (3-5%) of sustained tropical storm-force winds. However, the port should remain aware of the potential for hazardous conditions outside the forecast cone and continue to monitor advisories.",All vessel movements within the port are prohibited and the port is closed to traffic.
"*   Vessel activity at Manatee County Port, FL should prepare for potential tropical-storm-force winds (39+ mph) by approximately 72 hours out, with a 46% probability of onset.
*   There is a 7% probability of sustained winds reaching 58+ mph (50 knots) and a less than 1% probability of sustained winds reaching 74+ mph (64 knots) within the same 72-hour timeframe.",All vessel movements within the port are prohibited and the port is closed to traffic.
"* Vessels at Manatee County Port, FL should anticipate potential disruptions and delays due to the forecast track of Tropical Storm Eta.
* There is a moderate probability (approximately 10-20%) of tropical-storm-force winds (39+ mph) reaching Manatee County Port by the 84-hour forecast mark, necessitating preparedness for adverse weather conditions.",All vessel movements within the port are prohibited and the port is closed to traffic.
"Here's the breakdown for Manatee County Port, FL at the 96-hour mark (12Z Wed to 12Z Thu):

*   **Probability of Sustained Winds:** The ""Future Wind Probability Table"" shows a 32% chance of sustained winds of at least 34 knots (39 mph) at Tampa, FL (which is the closest major port listed in the table to Manatee County Port).
*   **Operational Impact:** Given the 32% chance of tropical-storm-force winds at Tampa, and that Manatee County Port is on the western side of Florida, it is highly probable that vessel activity would be significantly impacted or suspended due to expected tropical storm conditions.",All vessel movements within the port are prohibited and the port is closed to traffic.
"Based on the provided materials, Manatee County Port, FL (represented by nearby locations like Tampa and Venice) shows a low probability of experiencing tropical storm-force winds (39 mph or greater) within the next 108 hours (which is beyond the 120-hour forecast period shown in the wind probability graphic).

Therefore, general vessel activity at Manatee County Port, FL is likely to continue with minimal to no operational disruptions related to Tropical Depression Eta at that time.",All vessel movements within the port are prohibited and the port is closed to traffic.
"Manatee County Port, FL (near Venice, FL) can expect a high probability (55%) of tropical storm force winds by 00Z Thu (7 PM EST Wed).
