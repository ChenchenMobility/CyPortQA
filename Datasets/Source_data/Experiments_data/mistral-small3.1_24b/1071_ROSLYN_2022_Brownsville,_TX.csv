"Tropical Storm Roslyn is expected to make landfall along the west-central Mexican coast on 23-10-2022. However, since Brownsville, TX, is located far from the expected landfall area and considering the storm's projected path, it is unlikely that Roslyn will have a significant impact on freight operations in Brownsville. Therefore, the end of any potential impact would coincide with the dissipation of the storm, which is expected to occur shortly after landfall. Thus, the expected end of any potential impact on freight at Brownsville, TX, would be around 24-10-2022.",10/22/2022
"Tropical Storm Roslyn is forecasted to move parallel to the southwestern coast of Mexico and approach the west-central coast of Mexico.
