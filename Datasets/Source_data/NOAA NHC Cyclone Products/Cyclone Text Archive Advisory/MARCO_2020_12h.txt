DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Marco was
located near latitude 27.6 North, longitude 88.2 West. Marco is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  Marco is 
forecast to approach the coast of Louisiana this afternoon, and 
then turn westward and move very close to the coast of Louisiana 
through Tuesday night.
 
Data from the Hurricane Hunter plane indicate that maximum
sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Further weakening is expected, and Marco is forecast to 
become a tropical depression late on Tuesday and dissipate on 
Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km), 
primarily northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Morgan City LA to Ocean Springs MS, including Lake Borgne...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to start by this 
afternoon in portions of the warning area.
 
RAINFALL:  Marco is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 3 to 5 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches across
portions of the northeast and north-central Gulf coast through
Tuesday.  This rainfall may result in areas of flash, urban and
small stream flooding along the area.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Marco are likely to affect portions of
the northern Gulf Coast for the next couple of days. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes will be possible today from 
southeast Louisiana to the western Florida Panhandle.
