"The image you've shared is a screenshot of the National Hurricane Center's track forecast cone for Tropical Cyclone Florence. As an analyst, I can provide information on which coastal regions might be most likely to be affected by such a tropical cyclone.

The map indicates that the eastern seaboard of the United States, particularly the states of North Carolina and South Carolina, are in the path of Tropical Cyclone Florence's forecasted track. These areas could potentially experience the effects of the storm, including strong winds, heavy rainfall, and potential coastal impacts such as storm surges or flooding.

In addition to these states, other coastal regions along the eastern seaboard might also be affected depending on the storm's trajectory and intensity. These regions include Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and even parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

Note: This is based on the given information and assumptions made about the future behavior of Hurricane Florence. The gale force probability is calculated using the formula \((P+Q)/2\), where \(P\) is the 12-hour probability and \(Q\) is the 24-hour probability, assuming no change in conditions between those two times. This calculation provides a rough estimate and may not be accurate due to the uncertainty in hurricane behavior over long periods.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '7%'}"

"The image you've provided shows a weather forecast for Hurricane Florence, issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) on September 11, 2018 at 5:00 AM Atlantic Standard Time (AST). It appears to be a forecast for the Atlantic Ocean region and mentions that the center of Florence was located near latitude 26.4 North, longitude 64.1 West and is moving toward the west-northwest at 15 mph (24 km/h). The storm is currently a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale with sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) or higher, and it is expected to strengthen further.

The forecast also includes details about the areas affected by Florence, such as the East Coast of the United States from Edisto Beach, South Carolina, northward to the North Carolina-Virginia border, including the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. A Storm Surge Watch has been issued for these areas, indicating a potential risk of life-threatening inundation from rising waters moving inland from the coastline. Additionally, a Hurricane Watch is in effect for the same region, warning that hurricane conditions are possible within 48 hours.

Regarding your question about the expected start of impact on freight at South Jersey Port Corp., NJ, I'm sorry but I don't have enough information to answer this question accurately.
