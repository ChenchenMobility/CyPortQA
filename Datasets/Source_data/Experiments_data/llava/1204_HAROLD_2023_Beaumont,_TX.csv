"The image shows a Tropical Storm Advisory from the National Weather Service (NWS) and it mentions that tropical storm conditions are possible within 12 to 24 hours across southern Texas on Tuesday.

"The image depicts a weather bulletin for Tropical Storm Warning number 1, issued by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on August 21, 2023 at 10:00 AM CDT (15:00 UTC). It covers parts of Texas, including the Rio Grande and Corpus Christi. The system is expected to develop into a tropical storm and bring heavy rainfall and storm surge to coastal areas.

The warning area includes the southern coast of Texas from Baffin Bay northward through Matagorda Bay to Port O'Connor. A watch has been issued for areas further north, including Sargent. The advisory indicates that tropical storm conditions are expected within 24 hours, and a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for areas further north.

The NHC suggests that the disturbance could develop into a tropical depression later today. It warns of heavy rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches across southern Texas on Tuesday and Wednesday, with isolated higher amounts of 7 inches. These conditions may lead to areas of flash and urban flooding. The surf is also expected to be dangerous along the immediate coast, with large waves.

The next advisory will be issued at 10:00 PM CDT (15:00 UTC).",8/23/2023
