"Okay, let's analyze the situation based on the provided information. I'll act as a cyclone and port operations analyst, considering the Track Forecast Cone, Wind Probability Forecast Graphic Product, Future Wind Probability Table, and Cyclone Public Advisory.

**1. Current Situation & Immediate Concerns**

*   **Location & Strength:** Hurricane Jose is currently located near 13.9°N, 45.8°W with maximum sustained winds near 65 kt (75 mph/120 km/h). It's moving WNW at 16 mph.
*   **Public Advisory:**  The latest public advisory indicates the hurricane is *intensifying*. The public advisory indicates no coastal watches or warnings are in effect.

**2. Track Forecast Analysis (Track Cone)**

*   The track cone shows Jose moving generally westward.
*   The cone indicates a potential path that will pass near/close to the Leeward Islands, but the exact proximity remains uncertain due to the cone's width. This is the most immediate area of concern.
*   The cone extends further west, potentially impacting areas near Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in several days.

**3. Wind Probability Forecast - Key Areas of Concern**

Let's focus on the Wind Probability Table for key islands and locations near Jose's potential path:

*   **Leeward Islands (Antigua, Saint Kitts-Nevis, Guadeloupe, etc.):**  These islands are closest to Jose's projected path.  Let's highlight some key points:
    *   **Onset Probability (34 kt winds):** There's a substantial probability (18-35%) of experiencing at least 34 kt (39 mph) winds beginning during the next 18 hours.
    *   **Cumulative Probability (50 kt winds):**  Some islands (Baruda, Antigua) have probabilities of 50 kt (58 mph) winds reaching up to 13% in the next 18 hours.
    *   **64 kt Winds (74 mph):** These are less likely but still present, with some islands showing a 1-6% chance within the next 24 hours.
*   **US Virgin Islands (St. Thomas, St. Croix):**  Similar trends to the Leeward Islands, with increasing probability of tropical-storm-force winds over the next 24-48 hours.
*   **Puerto Rico:**  Increasing risk of tropical-storm-force winds over the next 36-72 hours, but the exact level of impact is still uncertain.

**4.  Port Operations Analysis & Recommendations**

Given this information, here's a breakdown of port operations considerations and recommendations:

*   **Immediate Action (Next 24-36 hours - Leeward Islands):**
    *   **Port Closures/Restrictions:**  The highest risk is for ports in the Leeward Islands. Consider pre-emptive port closures, especially for smaller ports or those with limited breakwater protection.  A full port closure is more likely if the forecast track continues to suggest a close passage.
    *   **Vessel Positioning:**  Advise vessels to seek safe harbor well in advance of the storm's arrival. Consider moving vessels further inland or to more sheltered anchorages.
    *   **Cargo Security:**  Secure all cargo on board vessels and at port facilities.  Ensure containers are properly lashed and that any loose materials are secured.
    *   **Personnel Safety:**  Prioritize the safety of port personnel.  Prepare evacuation plans and ensure everyone is aware of the potential hazards.
    *   **Communication:** Maintain constant communication with vessels, port authorities, and local weather services.
*   **Medium-Term Action (Next 72 hours - Puerto Rico & US Virgin Islands):**
    *   **Monitor Closely:**  Continue to monitor the forecast and prepare for potential impacts in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
    *   **Pre-position Supplies:**  Consider pre-positioning emergency supplies and equipment at vulnerable ports.
    *   **Review Contingency Plans:**  Ensure contingency plans are up-to-date and that all personnel are familiar with them.
*   **General Considerations:**
    *   **Wave Height:**  Prepare for potentially dangerous wave heights, which can cause damage to port infrastructure and vessels.
    *   **Storm Surge:**  Be aware of the potential for storm surge, especially in low-lying areas.
    *   **Infrastructure Assessment:** Post-storm, perform a thorough assessment of port infrastructure for damage.
