DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fred was
located near latitude 27.9 North, longitude 86.0 West. Fred is
moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this general motion 
with a slight increase in forward speed is expected through today.
On the forecast track, the center of Fred should move across the
northeastern Gulf of Mexico today, and make landfall in the western 
Florida Panhandle this afternoon or early evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast before landfall. After 
landfall, Fred is expected to quickly weaken.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).

RAINFALL: 

Fred is expected to produce the following rainfall amounts:

Through Today…

Southern and Central Florida... 1 to 2 inches of additional rain 
with isolated maximum storm totals of 5 inches are expected..

Through Tuesday…

The Florida Big Bend and Panhandle... 4 to 8 inches of rain with 
isolated maximum storm totals of 12 inches are expected.

Southeast Alabama through western and northern Georgia, and the 
western Carolinas... 4 to 7 inches of rain with isolated maximum 
storm totals of 10 inches are expected.

Through Wednesday…

Portions of the Mid-Atlantic States...2 to 4 inches of rain with 
isolated maximum storm totals of 6 inches expected as Fred interacts 
with a nearby front.

Heavy rainfall across portions of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic 
States could lead to flash, urban, small stream and isolated river 
flooding impacts.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Indian Pass, FL to Steinhatchee River, FL...3-5 ft
Steinhatchee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...2-4 ft
AL/FL border to Indian Pass including Pensacola Bay, Choctawhatchee
Bay and Saint Andrew Bay... 1-3 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Aripeka, FL...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning area beginning later this morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fred are expected to reach the coasts of
Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle today, and could
causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office for more details.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two will be possible early this morning
over the Florida west coast and Panhandle, and during the late
morning and into the afternoon from the Florida Panhandle northward
into southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama.
