"The image you've provided appears to be a track forecast cone for Tropical Cyclone Marco from the National Hurricane Center, along with a map showing the current position and potential track of the storm.

According to the image, the most likely regions to be affected by Tropical Cyclone Marco are not labeled as coastal regions but rather as ""Port Operations"" areas. These operations areas are marked by squares on the map with various symbols indicating ports or other points of interest that might require attention in response to the storm's predicted path.

Without a more detailed view, it is difficult to determine exactly which specific coastal regions will be most affected by Tropical Cyclone Marco. However, you can interpret that all coastal areas encompassed within the forecast cone are at risk of being impacted by the storm in some way.","Central and eastern Louisiana coastline, Mississippi and Alabama Gulf coasts"
The image does not provide specific information about which coastal region is most likely to be affected by the tropical cyclone based on the map and current forecasts.
