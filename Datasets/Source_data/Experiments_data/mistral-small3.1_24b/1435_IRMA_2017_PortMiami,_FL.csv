"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at PortMiami, FL within the next 5 days, we need to locate the relevant data for PortMiami (which is often represented as Miami, FL in such reports).

In the provided data, Miami, FL is not explicitly listed. However, we can use the data for Miami Beach, FL, which is often used as a proxy for PortMiami.

The cumulative probabilities for Miami Beach, FL (34-kt winds) are as follows:
- Day 1: 1%
- Day 2: 7%
- Day 3: 26%
- Day 4: 13%
- Day 5: 2%

To find the cumulative probability, we sum these probabilities:

1 + 7 + 26 + 13 + 2 = 49

So, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at PortMiami, FL within the next 5 days is:

"The forecast data provided does not include specific entries for PortMiami, FL. However, it does include entries for Miami, FL (MIA). Assuming PortMiami, FL is represented by the data for Miami, FL (MIA), we can analyze the probabilities for the different time intervals:

- 0-12 hours: 34 kt wind probability is 99
- 12-24 hours: 34 kt wind probability is 99
- 24-48 hours: 34 kt wind probability is 99
- 48 hours or more: 34 kt wind probability is 99

Since all intervals show the same probability of 99, we cannot determine a higher probability based on the provided data. However, if we strictly follow the question format, we would choose:

C. 24-48 hours",C.

"The table does not include specific data for PortMiami, FL. However, based on the provided data for other locations, it seems that the highest probabilities for 34-kt winds are often found in the 24-48 hours interval. Since PortMiami is not listed, I cannot provide a definitive answer, but based on the pattern observed in the data, the highest probability would likely be in the 24-48 hours interval if data were available.

Therefore, the answer would be:
C. 24-48 hours",D.

"The data provided does not include specific information for PortMiami, FL. However, based on the format and the typical structure of such forecasts, we can infer that the highest probability for 34-kt winds would likely be within the earliest time intervals, as the impact generally diminishes over time.
