"The provided advisory details Hurricane Matthew's position and expected track.

*   **Location:** 16.9N 74.6W (Southwest of Tiburon, Haiti)
*   **Movement:** North at 7 mph (11 km/h)
*   **Expected Track:** Will approach southwestern Haiti tonight and Tuesday morning, move near eastern Cuba late Tuesday, and move near or over portions of the southeastern and central Bahamas Tuesday night and Wednesday.

The options provided are all ports in the United States, and the hurricane is currently located in the Caribbean, moving north. Based on the projected track, the hurricane will move towards Cuba and the Bahamas before potentially impacting the southeastern United States.

Let's evaluate each option:

*   **A. Wilmington, NC:** This port is on the east coast of the US, further north than the current storm track. While it might be affected later, it's not the most likely to experience gale-force winds *first* based on this advisory.
*   **B. Houston Port Authority, TX:** This port is on the Gulf Coast of Texas. The current track is far from this region.
*   **C. South Jersey Port Corp, NJ:** This port is on the northeast coast of the US, even further north than Wilmington.
*   **D. Tampa Port Authority, FL:** This port is on the west coast of Florida. The hurricane is currently forecast to move north through the Bahamas and potentially impact the east coast of Florida. A direct impact on Tampa is less likely based on this track compared to ports further south and east on the Atlantic coast.

However, the question asks which port is *most likely* to experience gale-force winds *first* among the given options. None of the listed US ports are in immediate danger according to this advisory. The advisory clearly states that Haiti, Cuba, and the Bahamas are in the direct path for imminent gale-force winds. Since the question requires selecting one of the US ports, and the storm is moving generally north, the southernmost US port that is still on a plausible, albeit later, path would be the best guess if we are forced to choose from these options.

Given the movement north, and the advisory mentioning the southeastern Bahamas and potential impact on the Florida peninsula and keys, Tampa on the west coast of Florida is unlikely to be affected first by this northern-moving storm compared to the east coast. Wilmington and South Jersey are much further north.

Re-evaluating, the question is a bit tricky because none of the US ports are the *immediate* focus of this advisory for experiencing gale-force winds first. The storm is currently south of Haiti. However, if we must pick one of the given options as the *most likely* to experience gale-force winds first *among these specific US ports*, we have to consider the general northward movement.

The advisory states: ""On the forecast track, the center of Matthew will approach southwestern Haiti tonight and Tuesday morning, move near eastern Cuba late Tuesday, and move near or over portions of the southeastern and central Bahamas Tuesday night and Wednesday.""

This implies that the southeastern US coast could be impacted after its passage over the Bahamas. Of the given US ports, Tampa is on the opposite coast of Florida from the primary expected track. Wilmington and South Jersey are too far north to be affected first.

Let's consider the potential recurve of the storm. If it recurves up the east coast of Florida, then ports on that coast would be affected before ports further north. However, Tampa is on the Gulf coast.

The provided advisory does not give enough information about a potential eastward turn to definitively say Tampa would be affected first among these. In fact, it suggests a westward movement relative to the Bahamas.

Let's assume the question is asking which port is *closest* to the storm's eventual path if it continues moving generally north and then potentially recurves. The advisory mentions ""Interests elsewhere in Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and in the Florida Peninsula and the Florida Keys should monitor the progress of Matthew."" This suggests the Florida peninsula is a key area of interest.

Between the US ports, Tampa is the furthest south, but on the wrong coast. Wilmington and South Jersey are on the east coast but much further north.

There seems to be a mismatch between the provided advisory and the choices, as the advisory focuses on the Caribbean and Bahamas, with general interest in the Florida Peninsula and Keys. None of the US ports listed are in the immediate path of gale-force winds in this advisory.

However, if we interpret ""most likely to experience gale-force winds first"" as the port that is *positioned* to be impacted earliest if the storm takes a general northward track and potentially brushes the US coast, we still lack clarity.

Let's reconsider the question in the context of a typical cyclone analyst's knowledge. If a storm is moving north through the Caribbean and approaching the Bahamas, the southeastern US coast is the next logical area of concern.

Let's assume, for the sake of answering the question with the given options, that the storm *will* eventually impact the US. Given the northward movement, ports further south on the east coast would be impacted before ports further north. However, Tampa is on the west coast.

There might be an intended interpretation of the question that isn't fully supported by the limited text. However, if forced to choose, and considering a potential northward trajectory, the Florida coast is the next significant landmass. Tampa is in Florida, but on the Gulf side.

Let's re-examine the forecast: ""On the forecast track, the center of Matthew will approach southwestern Haiti tonight and Tuesday morning, move near eastern Cuba late Tuesday, and move near or over portions of the southeastern and central Bahamas Tuesday night and Wednesday.""

This forecast implies a significant impact on the Bahamas. The next major landmass for a northward-moving storm would be the US East Coast.

Given the options, and the *general* northward movement, a storm moving from the Caribbean towards the Bahamas would be expected to impact the Florida coast (Atlantic side) before hitting the Carolinas. Tampa is on the Gulf coast.

This is a difficult question given the options and the specific advisory text. However, if we must pick the *most likely* among these choices to experience gale-force winds *first*, and considering the storm is moving north, then any port on the US East Coast would be a candidate if the storm recurves or tracks up the coast.

Let's assume the question is flawed and tries to get at which US location is geographically closest to the storm's *current* general path if it were to move directly north towards the US.

Currently at 16.9N 74.6W.
Wilmington, NC: ~34.2N 77.9W
Houston, TX: ~29.7N 95.3W
South Jersey, NJ: ~39.8N 74.5W
Tampa, FL: ~27.9N 82.5W

If the storm moved directly north, it would pass between the US East Coast and the Bahamas. Tampa is southwest of this general path. Wilmington and South Jersey are northeast.

Let's consider the ""Interests elsewhere in Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and in the Florida Peninsula and the Florida Keys should monitor the progress of Matthew."" This statement points to the Florida Peninsula.

Among the given options, Tampa is in Florida. While it's on the Gulf coast, it's geographically closer to the general area of interest mentioned in the advisory than Wilmington or South Jersey, which are much further north. Houston is on the Gulf Coast but west of Florida.

Given that the storm is moving north, and the Florida Peninsula is mentioned as an area of interest, Tampa, being the southernmost of the East Coast-proximate options (even though on the opposite coast), might be considered the ""first"" in terms of latitude progression if the storm were to interact with Florida at all. This is a weak inference.

Let's critically re-examine the question and options without assuming a recurve. The storm is moving North.
The storm is at 16.9N.
Tampa is at 27.9N.
Wilmington is at 34.2N.
South Jersey is at 39.8N.

If the storm continues moving north, it will encounter progressively higher latitudes. Tampa is at the lowest latitude among the US ports listed. Therefore, if it were to hit the US coast along a general northward track, it would reach the latitude of Tampa before it reaches the latitude of Wilmington or South Jersey.

The caveat is that the storm might not track directly north, and it's on the Atlantic side of Florida. However, the question asks which is *most likely* to experience gale-force winds *first*. If we consider the storm's current latitude and its northward movement, the southernmost US port mentioned is the most plausible candidate to be reached first in terms of latitude.

Let's assume the question is asking about the progression of latitude.

The final answer is $\boxed{D}$.",A.
