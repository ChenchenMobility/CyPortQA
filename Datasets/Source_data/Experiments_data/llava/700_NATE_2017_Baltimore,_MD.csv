"The image you provided shows a chart from the National Hurricane Center depicting the forecast track of a tropical cyclone over the Atlantic Ocean. It appears to be a map with various areas labeled such as ""Current Eyewall,"" ""Forecast Track Cone,"" and ""Track Forecast Cone.""

To answer your question, the current eye of the tropical cyclone is at coordinates: '32.4N, 77.6W'. This indicates that the center of the storm, which typically has the lowest air pressure and the most intense winds, is located approximately in these latitude and longitude coordinates. However, please note that tropical cyclones can change their structure over time, so the location of the eye might shift as the storm evolves.","12.2N, 81.9W"
