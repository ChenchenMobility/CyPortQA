"Tsunami warnings are not applicable to Tampa Port Authority, FL, as it is not located in a tsunami-prone area.",Minor coastal rip-current risk on Gulf beaches
Tsunami warnings may be issued if the storm approaches the coast.,Enhanced rip-current risk along Gulf beaches; minor operational delays from squalls.
Tornadoes are a potential hazard along the coast of South Carolina and North Carolina.,Increased rip-current risk in the Gulf may occur but no major operational hazards expected
The potential for hazardous surf and rip current conditions along the east coast of Florida due to swells generated by Isaias.,Occasional lightning in squalls; choppy bay/near-shore seas could hamper small-craft movements
Tsunami watch for the Tampa Bay area.,Brief reductions in visibility and increased lightning risk in squalls; potential vessel schedule disruptions due to precautionary routing around the peninsula.
Tsunami watch for the Tampa Bay area.,Rough bay/near-shore seas and higher than normal tides could briefly affect small-craft operations
Tsunami warning,"Minimal – routine marine operations may see higher Atlantic swells, but Gulf waters near the port remain largely undisturbed."
Swells generated by Isaias are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Choppy bays/seas and dangerous rip currents in the eastern Gulf could briefly disrupt vessel movements.
High winds and potential for storm surge could impact port operations.,Choppy seas in the approaches to Tampa Bay and occasional squalls could disrupt vessel scheduling even without a direct strike.
Tsunami warnings may be issued if the storm approaches the coast.,Dangerous rip currents and rough seas in approaches; intermittent squalls reducing visibility and hampering cargo handling
