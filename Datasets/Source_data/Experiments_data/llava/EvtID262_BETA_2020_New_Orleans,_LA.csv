An additional hazard in the area for possible future storm is flooding from broken levees or overflowing drainage systems.,Isolated tornadoes in outer rain bands; dangerous rip currents along Gulf beaches
The image shows a Tropical Storm Beta track forecast map with multiple hazard names and a warning message about potential inland watches and warnings from NOAA. It also includes a detailed graphic showing the expected path of the storm and a legend for different types of watches and warnings.,Flash-flooding of low-lying/poor-drainage areas; dangerous rip currents along Gulf beaches.
"The image is not showing any additional hazards such as tornadoes or flooding. It only shows the track forecast cone for Tropical Storm Beta and its projected landfall at Port Aransas, Texas to Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana.",Isolated tornadoes and waterspouts possible as outer rainbands move onshore
A potential for flash flooding due to heavy rainfall.,Dangerous rip currents along south-facing beaches of southeast Louisiana; minor river rises possible in the Mississippi and Pearl basins.
There are no other hazards depicted in this image.,Dangerous rip currents along Gulf beaches; minor river rises possible in southeast Louisiana
"The image does not provide information about additional hazards associated with the possible future storm at New Orleans, LA.",Elevated seas and strong rip currents along the open Gulf beaches; minor navigation restrictions possible on lower Mississippi River due to swell
Potential flooding in areas prone to such events.,Dangerous rip currents and higher than normal seas across the north-central Gulf
"Possible future storm at New Orleans, LA might cause traffic disruptions due to road closures and evacuations.","Elevated surf and rip-current risk along Gulf beaches may extend eastward into Louisiana early next week, but direct operational impacts at the port are minimal at this time."
Flooding may occur due to heavy rainfall from the tropical depression.,None anticipated that would meaningfully affect port operations
