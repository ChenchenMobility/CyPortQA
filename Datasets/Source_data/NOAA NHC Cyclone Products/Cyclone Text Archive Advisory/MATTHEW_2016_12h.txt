DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Matthew was
located near latitude 31.2 North, longitude 80.5 West. Matthew is
moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue tonight.  A turn toward toward the
north-northeast and then to the northeast is expected on Saturday.
On the forecast track, the center of Matthew will continue to move
near or over the coast of Georgia through tonight, near or over the
coast of South Carolina later tonight and Saturday, and near the
coast of southern North Carolina on Saturday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Although weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours,
Matthew is expected to remain a hurricane while the center is near
the coast.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).  NOAA buoy 41008 located off of the Georgia coast recently
reported sustained winds of 54 mph (87 km/h) and a wind gust of 72
mph (115 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected to
continue over the warning area in Georgia tonight, and spread
northward elsewhere within the warning area through Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions in northeastern Florida should subside
tonight.

Residents in high-rise buildings should be aware that the winds at
the top of a 30-story building will be, on average, about one
Saffir-Simpson category higher than the winds near the surface.

Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch and
Tropical Storm Warning area in North Carolina by Saturday night or
Sunday morning, with tropical storm conditions expected by Saturday
morning.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge, the tide,
and large and destructive waves will cause normally dry areas near
the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the
shoreline.  The water could reach the following heights above ground
if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, to Edisto Beach, South Carolina,
including portions of the St. Johns River...6 to 9 ft
Edisto Beach, South Carolina to Cape Fear, North Carolina...
5 to 7 ft
Cape Fear to Duck, North Carolina, including portions of the
Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds...2 to 4 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  Large waves generated by Matthew will cause water
rises to occur well in advance of and well away from the track of
the center.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

There is a danger of life-threatening inundation during the next 36
hours along the Florida northeast coast, the Georgia coast, the
South Carolina coast, and the North Carolina coast from the
Volusia/Brevard county line, Florida, to Cape Fear, North Carolina.
There is the possibility of life-threatening inundation during the
next 48 hours from north of Cape Fear to Duck, North Carolina. For
a depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype National
Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic. For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.

The Prototype Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic is a depiction of
areas that would qualify for inclusion under a storm surge watch or
warning currently under development by the National Weather Service
and planned for operational use in 2017.  The Prototype Graphic is
available at hurricanes.gov.

RAINFALL:  Matthew is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 8 to 12 inches over the Atlantic coast of the United States from
eastern Georgia into eastern North Carolina and southeast
Virginia...with possible isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches.
This rainfall may result in life threatening flooding and flash
flooding. Rains will continue to diminish across northern Florida
tonight  with additional amounts up to an inch possible.

TORNADOES:  A tornado or two remains possible near the South
Carolina coast for the remainder of tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew will continue to affect portions
of the Bahamas and the east coast of Florida during the next few
days, and will spread northward along the southeast U.S. coast
through the weekend.  These swells will likely cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products
from your local weather office.
