"Based on the provided table, Corpus Christi, TX is not listed. However, the nearest locations with data are Brownsville TX and Harlingen TX. Given that these locations have cumulative probabilities of 14% and 12% respectively for 34-kt winds respectively, and considering Corpus Christi's position relative to these locations, a reasonable estimate for the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Corpus Christi, TX within the next 5 days would be between these two values. Since we need to provide a single number, we can average these two probabilities:

(14% + 12%) / 2 = 8%",14%
