"To determine the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Jacksonville, FL within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities listed for the 50-kt wind speed at Jacksonville, FL for each of the next five days.

However, Jacksonville, FL is not explicitly listed in the provided data. The closest relevant data points are for St. Marks, FL and Apalachicola, FL. We can use these as proxies for Jacksonville, FL.

For St. Marks, FL (50-kt winds):
- Day 1: X (0%)
- Day 2: X (0%)
- Day 3: 26%
- Day 4: 24%
- Day 5: X (0%)

For Apalachicola, FL (50-kt winds):
- Day 1: X (0%)
- Day 2: X (0%)
- Day 3: 12%
- Day 4: 8%
- Day 5: X (0%)

Since Jacksonville, FL is not listed, we can take an average of the probabilities for St. Marks, FL and Apalachicola, FL for each day:

- Day 3: (26% + 12%) / 2 = 19%
- Day 4: (24% + 8%) / 2 = 16%

Days 1, 2, and 5 have probabilities of 0%, so they do not contribute to the cumulative probability.

The cumulative probability is the sum of the probabilities for each day:

19% + 16% = 35%

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Jacksonville, FL within the next 5 days is 35.",7%

Given the absence of Jacksonville, FL, we need to infer based on surrounding areas or use the closest available data.

Since the question specifically asks for the highest 34-kt wind probability and we do not have direct data for Jacksonville, FL, we cannot accurately determine the correct interval. However, if we were to make an educated guess based on typical tropical cyclone behavior and the structure of the data provided, we would look for the interval where probabilities are highest for nearby locations.

Given the structure of the data and the typical behavior of tropical cyclones, the highest probabilities often occur in the 24-48 hour interval as the system approaches and impacts the area.
