HURRICANE BERNARDINE,Elevated rip-current risk along Maryland and Delaware beaches; lowered ceilings and visibility may disrupt flight operations at nearby airports.
"Rip currents are expected along the beach in Baltimore, MD, as swells generated by Tropical Storm Ana continue to affect coastal areas.",Elevated waves and rip-current risk along the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic beaches could affect vessel traffic and pilot operations.
Hanna,Increased rip-current risk at nearby Atlantic beaches; slight coastal flooding at high tide.
"Tornadoes are possible as Ana's outer rain bands interact with the cooler air of the Mid-Atlantic region, posing a hazard to the Baltimore area.",Enhanced rip currents and minor coastal/Chesapeake Bay flooding possible during high tide cycles
Ana.,Dangerous rip currents along nearby Atlantic beaches; reduced visibility in heavy rain could disrupt vessel movements
