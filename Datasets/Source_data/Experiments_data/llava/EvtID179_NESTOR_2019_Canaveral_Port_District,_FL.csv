"The image shows a map from the National Hurricane Center, and it displays the track of a tropical cyclone. The storm has an eye at the coordinates '32.4N, 77.6W', which is near the Florida Panhandle coastline. However, without additional context or information about the current position of the storm, I can only provide the coordinates of the eye of the tropical cyclone as listed on the map from NHC. Please note that tropical cyclones are dynamic systems and their positions may change over time.","28.8N, 86.3W"

"The image shows that the storm is located SW of Apalachicola Florida and SSW of Panama City Florida, but it doesn't provide information on when Canaveral Port District will begin experiencing tropical storm conditions. However, since Nestor is moving toward the northeast, it can be inferred that the storm will move further northwestward over time. Therefore, based on this information and assuming a direct path towards Canaveral Port District, we can estimate that the port district will most likely begin experiencing tropical storm conditions around 12-24 hours from now (the estimated time is based on the current movement of the storm).",6
