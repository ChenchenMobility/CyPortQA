"C. 10-20 vessels



**Explanation:**

The advisory mentions ""tropical storm conditions are possible...along the east coast of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina Wednesday night and Thursday."" This implies potential disruptions to port operations. Given the average daily vessel count of around 11, a disruption lasting a day and a half (Wednesday night and Thursday) could reasonably impact 10-20 vessels.



The other options are less likely:

*   **A. None:** Unlikely given the potential for disruption.
*   **B. 1-10 vessels:** Seems too low considering the potential duration of the event.
*   **D. 20 vessels or more:** This would imply a very significant disruption, which isn't explicitly indicated by the advisory.",B.

A. None,B.

"Based on the provided text, the predicted rainfall amounts for the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia are 3-6 inches, with isolated totals of up to 10 inches. This level of rainfall would likely disrupt port operations.

The text doesn't give a direct number of affected vessels. However, considering the potential for disruption, a reasonable estimate would be a significant impact, more than just a few vessels. Given the average daily number of vessels (11), a significant disruption would likely mean fewer than that.

Therefore, the most logical answer is **C. 10-20 vessels**.



**Important Note:** This is an estimation based on the information provided. A real-world assessment would require more detailed data about the port's specific vulnerabilities and operational procedures.",B.
