Explanation: The gale force probability is evaluated as 34kt (knots) based on the wind speeds. The wind speeds at each time point are estimated to be within the range of gale force winds, which is between 28 and 55 kt. Therefore, it is likely that there will be some wind speeds within this range during all of the given future hours. However, the actual wind speeds may vary, so these probabilities are estimates based on current forecasts.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '1%', 'in 72h': '2%', 'in 96h': '5%'}"
