DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nineteen
was located near latitude 25.6 North, longitude 81.1 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a
turn toward the west-northwest is expected later today.  A
west-northwestward or northwestward motion with a decrease in
forward speed is then expected during the next couple of days.  On
the forecast track, the center is forecast to move over the
southeastern and eastern Gulf of Mexico later today and Sunday, and
then move over the north-central Gulf of Mexico Sunday night and
Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected when the center moves over the
Gulf of Mexico, and the depression is expected to become a tropical
storm later today or tonight and gradually intensify Sunday and
Monday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
