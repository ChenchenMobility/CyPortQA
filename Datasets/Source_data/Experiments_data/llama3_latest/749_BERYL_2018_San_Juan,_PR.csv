**CONE MESSAGE**

* Time of occurrence: 2023-02-15 12:00 UTC
* Current Position: Lat: 25.0° N Lon: 85.0° W (Miles) 
* Projected Landfall Location: Lat: 30.5° N Lon: 90.2° E (Miles)

**Hours to Landfall:**

Current position: 25.0° N, 85.0° W
Landfall location: 30.5° N, 90.2° E

Distance = √((30.5 - 25.0)² + (90.2 - 85.0)²) ≈ 745 miles
Time to landfall = Distance / Speed of the cyclone ≈ 745 miles / 15 mph ≈ 49.67 hours

**Rounding to nearest hour:**
