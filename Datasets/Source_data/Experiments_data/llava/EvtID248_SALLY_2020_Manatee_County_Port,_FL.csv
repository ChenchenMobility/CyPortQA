"The image provided is a screenshot from a weather forecast, specifically related to tropical storms (TS) and hurricanes. It appears to be an advisory or alert from the National Weather Service, which displays various weather maps, including a track forecast cone for a named tropical cyclone (currently Tropical Storm Ida).

The image shows the United States with different areas highlighted due to their proximity to the storm's path. The areas under TS and hurricane warnings are not explicitly labeled as 'location1' to 'location2' in the format you requested. However, the map indicates that several coastal states in the Gulf of Mexico, such as Louisiana and Mississippi, are under these warning levels. Additionally, parts of Florida and the southeastern United States could also be affected due to their proximity to the storm's potential path as it moves northwestward over time.

For a detailed list of areas under TS or hurricane warnings, one would need to refer to official weather advisories from the National Weather Service for the most accurate and up-to-date information.",None in effect at 08:00 AM EDT 12-Sep-2020
