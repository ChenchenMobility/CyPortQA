"The 34-kt wind probability for Port of Brunswick, GA in the table is shown from 18Z Fri to 18Z Tue. To find out how many hours remain until the 34-kt wind probability peaks, we need to look at the time and probability values for each period.

The peak probability value for the 34-kt wind speed occurs on Sun 18Z between 06Z SAT and 18Z SAT. The probability value at this time is 2( 2). To find out how many hours remain until this peak, we need to subtract the current UTC time from the start time of this period.

The current UTC time is 2100Z (Friday, September 13, 2019 at 3:00 PM EDT) and the start time for the 34-kt wind probability on Sun 18Z between 06Z SAT and 18Z SAT is also 18Z. Therefore, we need to subtract 18 hours from the current UTC time to get the time of the peak probability value:

2100Z - 1800Z = 300 hours

Therefore, there are approximately 300 hours (or about 12.5 days) remaining until the 34-kt wind probability peaks at Port of Brunswick, GA within the next 5 days.",96
