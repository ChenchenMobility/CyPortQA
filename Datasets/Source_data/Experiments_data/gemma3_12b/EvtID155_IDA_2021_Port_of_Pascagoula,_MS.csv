"B. 1-10 vessels



**Explanation:**

The advisory discusses potential impacts from Ida, including swells and rainfall. Pascagoula is within the area of potential impact. Given the advisory's language about swells and potential disruptions, it's reasonable to expect some vessels to be delayed or seek shelter. However, a complete shutdown (20+ vessels) seems unlikely based on the information provided. A few vessels (1-10) being impacted by delays or seeking shelter is a more probable scenario.",B.
D. 20 vessels or more,B.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The forecast indicates the system could be near major hurricane strength when it approaches the northern Gulf Coast on Sunday. Pascagoula is a significant port on the northern Gulf Coast. Major hurricane conditions would severely disrupt port operations. Given the average daily number of vessels and the potential for significant disruption, a larger impact is plausible.",B.
D. 20 vessels or more,B.
