"Tornadoes are possible this afternoon through tonight near the coasts of Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.",None of operational significance expected at Port Arthur
"Lightning strikes are expected to be a significant hazard during Gordon's passage near Port Arthur, Texas, potentially causing power outages and disruptions to port operations.","Elevated seas and rip currents in the near-shore approaches, but no major operational hazards expected"
Tornadoes are possible through tonight across the southern and west-central Florida Peninsula.,"Marginal threat of isolated brief tornadoes in outer rain-bands if the track shifts west, but overall risk is low"
Flooding is possible from the heavy inland flooding potential due to the expected 2-4 inches of rain across eastern Texas.,Isolated brief tornadoes possible in outer rainbands if the center passes slightly farther west
Isolated tornadoes may be possible within the Texas coast's landfall zone due to the system's interaction with warm Gulf waters and nearby terrain features.,Elevated seas and swells near the Sabine Pass approaches could briefly disrupt pilot boarding and some cargo operations.
