"Tropical storm force wind speed probabilities for the storm shown on the National Hurricane Center graphic product. This image shows the probabilities of different wind speeds occurring within 50 km (31 miles) of a point, which is located at 28.9° N and 81.7° W. The colors in the image represent the probability of reaching certain wind speed thresholds: green represents less than 50 knots (57 mph), yellow represents between 50 and 63 knots (69 mph), red represents between 63 and 78 knots (84 mph), and purple represents greater than 78 knots (91 mph). The image also includes a forecast track for the storm, which shows the projected path of the storm over the next several days. Additionally, the image indicates that the storm is expected to make landfall on Tuesday, October 23, with winds of at least 50 knots (57 mph) and a probability of reaching sustained winds of at least 64 knots (75 mph). However, it is important to note that these forecasts are subject to change as the storm evolves.","Northern Gulf Coast from Louisiana eastward across the Florida Big Bend and then inland across GA, SC and NC"
