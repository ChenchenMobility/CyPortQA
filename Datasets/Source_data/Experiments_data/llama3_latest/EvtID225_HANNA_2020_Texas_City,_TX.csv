"Tornadoes are expected to be possible, mainly overnight, across portions of Texas City, TX, as Hanna makes landfall.",Dangerous surf and rip currents along nearby beaches; brief tornadoes cannot be ruled out Saturday night.
"Isolated tornadoes are possible within the warning area, particularly around the time of landfall.",High surf and dangerous rip currents along the Upper Texas coast beginning Friday and persisting through Saturday.
"Isolated tornadoes and waterspouts are possible near the Texas coast as the system interacts with the dry air to the west, increasing the threat of twister formation over coastal areas.",High surf and dangerous rip currents along adjacent beaches; reduced visibility in heavy squalls.
Isolated tornadoes may develop over the region by Saturday night into Sunday as the system's interaction with land and surrounding moisture increases.,High surf and dangerous rip currents beginning Friday; brief tornado/spin-up risk in outer rain bands Saturday
"Isolated tornadoes are possible in association with the tropical cyclone's landfall along the Texas coast, including Texas City, due to strong wind shear and complex weather interactions.",High surf and dangerous rip currents affecting marine operations
