"The forecast data for San Juan, PR, is not provided in the given text. However, based on the typical structure of such reports, the highest 34-kt wind probability for San Juan, PR, would likely be indicated in the earliest time intervals if the storm is approaching. Since the question asks for the highest probability, we would look for the interval with the highest number of 34-kt wind occurrences.

Given the structure of the report, the highest probability would typically be in the earliest time intervals. However, without the specific data for San Juan, PR, we cannot definitively answer. If we were to guess based on typical storm movement and reporting structures, it would likely be:

A. 0-12 hours

Since the question asks for the first time the probability of 34-kt winds at San Juan, PR rises above zero, and San Juan, PR is not listed, the answer is not available within the choices provided.

However, if we were to assume that San Juan, PR should be included and follow a similar pattern to other locations, we would look for the first non-zero value in the probability column for 34-kt winds. Since San Juan, PR is not listed, we cannot provide an accurate answer based on the given information.

If this were a multiple-choice question and we had to guess based on the pattern of other locations, we might infer that the probability rises above zero within a certain time frame. But since the question specifically asks for the data from San Juan, PR, and it is not provided, the answer is:
