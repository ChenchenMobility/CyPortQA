DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
 
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the remnants of Fred were located near
latitude 24.4 North, longitude 84.6 West. The remnants are moving
toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue through tonight, with a turn toward
the north expected on Monday.  On the forecast track, the system
will cross the southeastern Gulf of Mexico today, cross the
east-central and northern Gulf of Mexico tonight and Monday, and
move inland along the northern Gulf coast Monday night or early
Tuesday morning.
 
Surface observations indicate that maximum sustained winds have
increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Fred is
expected to re-develop into a tropical storm later today, with
gradual strengthening expected while it moves over the Gulf of
Mexico until it makes landfall.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on nearby surface
observations is 1011 mb (29.86 inches).

your local National Weather Service forecast office.

by late Monday night or Tuesday morning.
