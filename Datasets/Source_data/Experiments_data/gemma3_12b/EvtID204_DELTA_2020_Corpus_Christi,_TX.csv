"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The provided text mentions that Delta is expected to produce heavy rainfall over portions of the central Gulf Coast, including the Corpus Christi area. While it doesn's provide a direct number, the mention of heavy rainfall and potential flooding suggests disruptions to port operations. Given the size of the Corpus Christi port and its typical vessel traffic, disruptions would likely affect at least 4 vessels to a large amount of commercial vessels.",C.
D. 20 vessels or more,C.
"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Explanation:**

The provided text indicates Delta is expected to bring heavy rainfall across portions of the central Gulf Coast into the southeastern United States later this week into the weekend. Corpus Christi, TX is within this area. Heavy rainfall and potential storm surge will cause port closures and disruptions to maritime traffic. Given the potential for significant disruption, it's reasonable to expect more than 20 vessels to be impacted.",C.
