"To find the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Beaumont, TX within the next 5 days, we need to locate Beaumont, TX in the provided data. However, Beaumont, TX is not listed in the provided data. The closest relevant location is Port Arthur, TX.

For Port Arthur, TX has the following probabilities for 34-kt wind arrival:

- Day 1: 0%
- Day 2: 3%
- Day 3: 14%
- Day 4: 7%
- Day 5: 1%

The cumulative probability is the 34-kt wind arrival within the next 5 days is the sum of these probabilities:

0 + 3 + 14 + 7 + 1 = 25

So, the cumulative probability is 25.",25%
