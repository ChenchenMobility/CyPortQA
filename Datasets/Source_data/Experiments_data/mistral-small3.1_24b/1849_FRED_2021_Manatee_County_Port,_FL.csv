"Based on the provided data, the port expected to be most affected is Key West, Florida. The forecast indicates that tropical-storm-force winds have a cumulative probability of 22% affecting Key West. The storm is expected to be in the vicinity of the Florida Keys on Saturday, August 14, 2021, and move away from the region by Sunday, August 15, 2021. Given that the storm is forecast to be in the area for approximately 1 day, and considering that ports typically require some time to reassess damage, coordinate repairs, and resume operations, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations could recover within 3 days after the storm passes. Therefore, the answer is 3.",2.0
