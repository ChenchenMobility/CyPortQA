Note that the gale force probability (34kt) refers to the likelihood of winds reaching 34 knots (17.5 mph or 28 km/h), which is roughly the threshold for a tropical storm in the Atlantic. The probability at 12 hours appears to be relatively high, while it decreases over time and is not present in the forecast after 48 hours. This suggests that the tropical depression may weaken as it moves northwestward, which aligns with the expected movement and intensification described in the advisory.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '1%', 'in 72h': '3%', 'in 96h': '1%'}"
