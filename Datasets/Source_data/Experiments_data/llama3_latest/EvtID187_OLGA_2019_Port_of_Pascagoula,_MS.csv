"Based on the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, the cyclone is currently at position (23.5, 84.5) and is projected to make landfall at position (26.3, 88.1). The distance between these two positions is approximately 245 nautical miles.

Using a speed of 10 knots for the cyclone, we can estimate the time it will take to cover this distance:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 245 nautical miles / 10 knots
= 24.5 hours

However, please note that landfall is not expected in this scenario, so the answer would be 'None'.",18
