"Hurricane Dorian's impacts on the Port of Savannah, GA are not expected to be direct or significant. The storm is moving northeastward away from the region. Therefore, there is no specific date for the expected start of impact on freight at the Port of Savannah, GA.",9/2/2019

"Hurricane Dorian was moving away from the U.S. East Coast and towards Atlantic Canada by September 7, 2019. Given that the storm was already well north of Savannah, GA, by that time, the expected end of impact on freight at the Port of Savannah would have been before this date.

Since the specific end date is not provided in the advisory, and the storm had already passed the region by September 7, 2019, we can infer that the impact would have been minimal to none by this date. However, without explicit information on the end of impacts, it is not possible to provide a precise date. Therefore, based on the information available, the impacts would have likely ended by 06-09-2019.",9/2/2019
