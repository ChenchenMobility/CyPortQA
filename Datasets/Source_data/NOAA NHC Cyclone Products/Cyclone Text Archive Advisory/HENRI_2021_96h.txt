DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Henri was
located near latitude 30.0 North, longitude 66.6 West. Henri is
moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue for another day or so.  A turn to the north is 
expected on Friday with that motion continuing into the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next 
couple of days, but Henri is expected to become a hurricane by the 
weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Henri should continue to affect Bermuda
during the next day or so.  Swells are expected to increase across
much of the east coast of the U.S. and Atlantic Canada later this
week and this weekend. These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
