"The image shows a public advisory from the National Hurricane Center regarding Tropical Storm Cristobal. It indicates that the storm is moving slowly over the southern Bay of Campeche and is forecast to be near the coast of the southern Bay of Campeche tonight through Thursday. While it is not clear from the image what the specific impact on South Louisiana, LA will be, it can be inferred that the tropical storm conditions are expected within 24 to 36 hours after the advisory was issued. As such, a reasonable estimate for when South Louisiana, LA is likely to begin experiencing tropical storm conditions would be around 10:00 PM CDT on Tuesday June 2, 2020, or around 3:00 AM CDT on Wednesday June 3, 2020. This estimate is based on the forecast track and timing provided in the advisory and assumes that the storm does not significantly alter its course or speed over the next few hours.",120
