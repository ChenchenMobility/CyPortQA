"The image you've provided shows the current advisory for Hurricane Irma by the National Hurricane Center. According to the advisory, as of 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), Hurricane Irma is moving just north of due west along the north coast of Cuba at near 9 mph (15 km/h). The core of Irma will continue to move near or over the north coast of Cuba this afternoon, and will reach the Florida Keys Sunday morning. It is expected to move along or near the southwest coast of Florida Sunday afternoon.

Therefore, it is likely that Port of Pascagoula, MS would begin experiencing tropical storm conditions sometime between late Saturday night (September 9th) to early Sunday morning (September 10th), as this is the time frame when Hurricane Irma is expected to make its way to Florida. However, it's important to note that hurricanes can be unpredictable and the exact timing may vary. It's always best to stay informed by monitoring local weather updates and advisories from the National Weather Service and your local emergency management officials.",16

"48-hour outlook: Irma is forecast to restrengthen a little more while it moves through the Straits of Florida and remain a powerful hurricane as it approaches the Florida Keys and the west coast of Florida. The duration of recovery for the port's freight cannot be determined from this information alone, as it depends on the impact of Irma, which is not fully predictable at this time. Port authorities would need to assess the damage once the storm has passed before providing an estimate of when operations can resume.",None

"The image you provided is of Hurricane Irma, which was a powerful and destructive storm that made landfall in Florida in September 2017. It caused extensive damage to the state and other areas affected by its winds and storm surge. It's difficult to predict how long it would take for a port's freight to recover from such an event as it depends on various factors, including the extent of the damage, resources available for recovery, and the demand for freight services in the area. Without more specific information about the extent of the damage to the port in question, it's not possible to give a number of days for the port's freight to recover.",None

"48-HOUR OUTLOOK:
------------------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Irma was located near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 67.7 West. Irma is moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days. On the forecast track, the extremely dangerous core of Irma will move away from Puerto Rico this morning, pass just north of the coast of Hispaniola later today, and be near the Turks and Caicos and southeastern Bahamas by this evening. 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum sustained winds are now near 180 mph (290 km/h) with higher gusts. Irma is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some fluctuations in intensity are likely during the next day or two, but Irma is forecast to remain a powerful category 4 or 5 hurricane during the next couple of days. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km). The minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane Hunter is 921 mb (27.20 inches). Storm surge flooding: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and large breaking waves will raise water levels ABOVE NORMAL TIDE LEVELS by the following amounts within the hurricane warning area near and to the north of the center of Irma. Turks and Caicos Islands...15 to 20 ft Southeastern and central Bahamas...15 to 20 ft Northern coast of the Dominican Republic...3 to 5 ft Northern coast of Haiti and the Gulf of Gonave...1 to 3 ft Water levels in the U.S. and British Virgin Islands will gradually subside tonight and early Thursday. Wind: Tropical Storm and Hurricane conditions will continue over portions of Puerto Rico for the next few hours. Hurricane conditions are expected to begin within the hurricane warning area in the Dominican Republic and Haiti today, with tropical storm conditions beginning in the next few hours. Hurricane conditions are expected to begin in the warning area in the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands later today with tropical storm conditions expected within the next several hours. These conditions will spread into the Central Bahamas by Thursday night or early Friday. Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area in Cuba by Friday. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within the warning area in Cuba Thursday night. Rainfall: Irma is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through Saturday: Northern Leeward Islands...Additional 1 to 3 inches. Storm total 8 to 12 inches, isolated 20 inches. Northeast Puerto Rico and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands...6 to 12 inches, isolated 20 inches. Southwest Puerto Rico...3 to 6 inches, isolated 10 inches. The Southern Leeward Islands, and Saint Croix...2 to 4 inches. Southeast Bahamas, Central Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands...8 to 12 inches, isolated 20 inches. Northern Dominican Republic and northern Haiti...4 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches. Eastern and Central Cuba...4 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches. Southwest Haiti...1 to 4 inches. In all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Surf: Swells generated by Irma will affect the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the southeastern Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, and portions of the southeast coast of the United States during the next several days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
