"Isolated instances of flooding, landslides, and power outages may occur across the island due to saturated soil conditions from Karen's passage.",Rough seas and dangerous rip currents; possible mudslides in steep terrain
"Isolated areas of isolated thunderstorms, lightning strikes, and cloud-to-ground lightning are expected to affect the Virgin Islands, including St. Croix, as Karen's outer rain bands interact with local terrain features.",Flash flooding and rapid rises on small streams; minor power interruptions possible.
Power outages are possible due to strong gusts and falling trees.,Rough seas and dangerous rip currents around the port approaches
Tornadoes are possible on the eastern end of St. Croix due to Karen's interaction with the mountainous terrain.,Rapidly deteriorating sea state and hazardous marine conditions affecting vessel operations and harbor approaches.
"Heavy flooding is expected due to Karen's rapid intensification over the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea, potentially causing significant damage to low-lying areas and infrastructure in the US and British Virgin Islands.",Rough seas and hazardous marine conditions beginning late Tuesday could disrupt port operations.
