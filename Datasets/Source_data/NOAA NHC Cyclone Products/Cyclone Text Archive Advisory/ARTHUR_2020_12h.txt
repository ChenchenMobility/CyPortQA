DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Arthur was
located by an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft near 
latitude 32.4 North, longitude 76.9 West.  Arthur is moving toward 
the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn toward the 
northeast with an increase in forward speed is forecast to occur on 
Monday.  A turn toward the east is expected on Tuesday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Arthur will remain well offshore of 
the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina overnight, and then move 
near or just east of the coast of North Carolina on Monday.  Arthur 
is forecast to turn away from the east coast of the United States 
Monday night and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours.  Arthur is 
likely to lose tropical characteristics Tuesday night and Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure measured by the reconnaissance 
aircraft is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the Tropical
Storm Warning area on Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Arthur is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
1 to 3 inches over coastal North Carolina Sunday night and Monday,
with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Arthur are affecting portions of the
southeast U.S. coast and are expected to spread northward along the
U.S. mid-Atlantic coast during the next day or two.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
