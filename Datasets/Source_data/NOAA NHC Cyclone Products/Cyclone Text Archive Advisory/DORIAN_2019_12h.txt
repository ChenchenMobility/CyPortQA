DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Dorian was located
near latitude 40.9 North, longitude 67.0 West.  Dorian is moving
toward the northeast near 25 mph (41 km/h), and this general motion
is expected through Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Dorian should pass to the southeast of extreme southeastern New
England this morning, and then move across Nova Scotia and
Newfoundland later today and tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight weakening is forecast, but Dorian is expected to
move over Nova Scotia with hurricane-force winds.  Thereafter,
Dorian is forecast to become a powerful post-tropical cyclone over
eastern Canada by tonight or early Sunday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from
the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310
miles (500 km).  A NOAA buoy at Nantucket Shoals, Massachusetts,
recently reported a sustained wind of 64 mph (104 km/h) and a gust
of 80 mph (129 km/h).  A Weatherflow station at Sagamore Beach,
Massachusetts, recently reported sustained winds of 40 mph (64 km/h)
and a gust of 51 mph (82 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in the
warning area over portions of extreme southeastern Massachusetts
during the next few hours.  These conditions should spread into
the warning area in Maine by this afternoon.

Regardless of whether Dorian is a hurricane or a post-tropical
cyclone, hurricane conditions are expected in the Hurricane Warning
area in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland beginning later today, and they
are possible in the Hurricane Watch area by tonight.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the Tropical Storm Warning area in
eastern Canada later today and tonight.

STORM SURGE: Storm Surge is likely in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the
Southwest Coast of Newfoundland, and Eastern Nova Scotia.

RAINFALL:  Dorian is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals through Saturday:

Extreme Southeastern New England and far eastern Maine...1 to 3
inches.

Nova Scotia...3 to 5 inches, isolated 7 inches.

New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island...2 to 4 inches

Newfoundland and far eastern Quebec...1 to 2 inches

This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods

SURF:  Large swells are increasing along the coast in Atlantic
Canada, and they will continue to affect that area during the next
few days.  Swells along the mid-Atlantic and New England coasts of
the U.S. will continue for a couple of more days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
