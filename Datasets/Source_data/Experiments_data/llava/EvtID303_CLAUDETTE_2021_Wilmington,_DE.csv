"Based on the information provided by the National Hurricane Center, it is not possible to accurately predict the exact date and time when the storm will have an impact on freight at Wilmington, DE. The NHC only provides forecasts for up to 5 days in advance, and the timing of the storm's arrival at a specific location can vary greatly depending on its track and intensity. Additionally, the expected impacts on freight would depend on the severity of the storm and how it interacts with local infrastructure and logistics systems. Therefore, it is not feasible to provide an answer without more information and a clear understanding of the storm's projected path and timeline.",6/18/2021
