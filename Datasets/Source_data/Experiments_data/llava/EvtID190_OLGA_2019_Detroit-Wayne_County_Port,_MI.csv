"Based on the image you provided, which appears to be a weather map from the National Weather Service, it seems that Tropical Depression Seventeen is moving across the southeastern United States and could impact areas like Michigan later. The map indicates that there is a chance of seeing tropical storm conditions with sustained winds of 34 kt (knots), which translates to 39 mph (63 km/h).

The National Weather Service has provided a probability chart for the forecast track area of Detroit-Wayne County Port, MI. The probabilities are given as percentages for different wind speeds:

- Sustained winds of 34 kt (39 mph) or higher: less than 1%
- Sustained winds of 50 kt (58 mph) or higher: less than 1%
- Sustained winds of 64 kt (74 mph) or higher: less than 1%

The map also shows the forecast track with different colors indicating the confidence in the forecast. Additionally, it includes information on the storm's position and movement across the country.

As for the specific question about when the peak impact on freight at Detroit-Wayne County Port, MI would be predicted, I would need a more detailed weather forecast or a different format to provide an answer in DD-MM-YYYY. The image only provides information up until October 25, and it doesn't contain enough details to predict the impact on freight at that location beyond this date.",None
