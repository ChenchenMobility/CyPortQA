"The image shows a weather forecast from the National Weather Service in Miami, Florida. The forecast indicates that a potential tropical cyclone is forming in the Gulf of Mexico and is expected to approach the Louisiana coast this weekend. The disturbance is currently near latitude 27.7 North, longitude 88.0 West and is moving toward the west-southwest at 9 mph (15 km/h). Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts. The system is expected to become a tropical depression on Thursday, a tropical storm by late Thursday, and a hurricane by late Friday.

The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the NOAA Hurricane Hunters and surface observations is 1009 mb (29.80 inches). The hazards affecting land include a dangerous storm surge and heavy rainfall. Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches are expected near and inland of the central Gulf Coast through early next week, with isolated maximum rainfall amounts of 20 inches. Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area by Friday night, with tropical storm conditions possible by early Friday. The next intermediate advisory is expected at 100 AM CDT, and the next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

As for your question, I cannot determine how many days it would take for a port's freight to recover from this weather event based solely on the image provided.
