during the next 36 hours in the indicated locations. For a depiction
of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beta was
located by NOAA Doppler weather radars and surface observations near
latitude 28.1 North, longitude 96.0 West. Beta is moving toward the
west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion is
forecast to continue today. A decrease in forward speed and a sharp
turn to the north and northeast are expected on Tuesday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Beta will continue to move toward the
central coast of Texas today and will likely move inland by tonight.
Beta is forecast to remain close to the coast of southeastern Texas
on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
Recent data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft and
with Doppler weather radars indicate that maximum sustained winds
have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Little
change in strength is forecast before Beta reaches the Texas coast.
Weakening is anticipated once Beta moves inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.  A Texas TCOON observing site at Port O'Connor,
Texas, has recently measured a wind gust to 43 mph (69 km/h). A NOAA
buoy located just east of Galveston, Texas, has recently reported a
wind gust to 43 mph (66 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on recent data from
the reconnaissance aircraft is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Port Aransas, TX to Sabine Pass, TX including Copano Bay, Aransas
Bay, San Antonio Bay, Matagorda Bay, and Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Ocean Springs, MS including Sabine Lake, Lake
Calcasieu, Vermilion Bay, Lake Borgne, Lake Pontchartrain, and Lake
Maurepas...1-3 ft
Baffin Bay, TX to Port Aransas, TX including Corpus Christi Bay and
Baffin Bay... 1-3 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande to Baffin Bay, TX...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin later this
morning in portions of the tropical storm warning area. Tropical
storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm watch area
later today.
 
RAINFALL: Through Friday, Beta is expected to produce rainfall
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches with isolated totals of 15 inches
from the middle Texas coast to southeast Louisiana. Rainfall totals
of 3 to 5 inches are expected northward into the ArkLaTex region and
east into the Lower Mississippi Valley through the end of the week.
Flash and urban flooding is likely, as well as isolated minor river
flooding.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two could occur today and tonight, near the
middle to upper Texas coast or the southwestern Louisiana coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by a combination of Beta and a cold front
over the northern Gulf of Mexico will continue along the coasts of
Louisiana and Texas during the next couple of days.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
