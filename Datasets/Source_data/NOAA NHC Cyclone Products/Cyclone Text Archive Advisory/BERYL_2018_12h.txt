DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the poorly defined center of Tropical
Storm Beryl was located near latitude 14.0 North, longitude 56.8
West.  Beryl is moving toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31
km/h), and this motion with an increase in forward speed is expected
during the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center
of Beryl or its remnants will approach the Lesser Antilles today,
cross the island chain tonight, and move near or south of the Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico on Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is anticipated during the next 48 hours,
and Beryl is forecast to degenerate into a trough of low pressure as
it moves across the Lesser Antilles and into the eastern Caribbean
Sea by Monday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in Dominica and
Guadeloupe tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are possible
in the watch areas of the Lesser Antilles by later today or Monday.
Strong gusty winds are also possible in the Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico on Monday.

RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 1 to 3 inches through Monday across the southern Leeward and
northern Windward Islands.  Across Puerto Rico, rainfall amounts
of 1 to 4 inches are expected.  Across the remainder of the Leeward
and Windward Islands and the Virgin Islands, rainfall amounts of
1 to 2 inches are expected, with locally higher amounts possible.
