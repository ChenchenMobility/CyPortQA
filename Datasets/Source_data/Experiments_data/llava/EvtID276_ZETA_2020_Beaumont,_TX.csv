However, if we consider the advisory as a general indication of the potential effects of the storm, it could affect ports along the northern Gulf Coast from Wednesday to Thursday.

"The image you have provided appears to be a weather map showing the current position and movement of Hurricane Zeta, which is expected to make landfall on the northern Gulf Coast in the United States. The map indicates that the storm is currently moving toward the northwest at 10 mph (17 km/h) and is forecast to approach the northern Gulf Coast in the watch area on Wednesday. It shows the maximum sustained winds near 80 mph (130 km/h), with some additional strengthening possible before Zeta makes landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula. The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).

The map also includes information on watches and warnings, as well as forecasts for the storm surge and rainfall associated with Zeta. It notes that a dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in the Hurricane Warning area near and to the north of where the center makes landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with local amounts of 12 inches are possible through Tuesday along and east-northeast of Zeta's track across the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, the Cayman Islands, and central to western Cuba.

The map also provides information on the timing of the storm and the areas that may be affected by the storm surge and rainfall. It notes that an initial area of heavy rains will begin to impact the central Gulf Coast Tuesday night, spreading north into the Tennessee Valley on Wednesday. The core of the heavy rains associated with Zeta will push northeast from eastern Louisiana across southern Mississippi, Alabama and northern Georgia through Wednesday night, and through the southern Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic on Thursday.

It is important to note that this information is based on the latest available forecasts, and the situation may change as the storm develops. It is also worth noting that storm surges can cause significant damage and pose a threat to life, so it is important for those in the affected areas to monitor local weather updates and take any necessary precautions.",0
