DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Fourteen
was located near latitude 15.4 North, longitude 83.1 West. The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 
km/h), and this general motion is forecast to continue this morning.
A turn toward the northwest with a decrease in forward speed is
expected by this afternoon and continuing through at least Sunday.
On the forecast track, the center of the system will move near or
just offshore the coasts of northern Nicaragua and northeastern
Honduras, including the Bay Islands, today and approach the east
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico on Saturday.  The center is
then expected to cross the Yucatan Peninsula Saturday night and move
into the south-central Gulf of Mexico on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and the 
depression is expected to become a tropical storm later today.
The system is forecast to be near or at hurricane strength when it
reaches the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico late Saturday.  Some 
weakening is expected as it traverses the Yucatan Peninsula 
Saturday night.  Afterward, restrengthening is forecast on Sunday 
as it moves offshore and enters the southern Gulf of Mexico

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

northeastern Honduras and northern Nicaragua within the warning
area this morning, making outside preparations difficult or
