"Tropical Depression One is expected to move offshore, but parallel to, the coast of Florida. Since Tampa is located on the Gulf Coast of Florida and the depression is moving along the east coast, the expected start of impact on freight at Tampa Port Authority, FL, would not be directly from this system. However, indirect impacts such as weather-related delays might occur due to widespread weather conditions.

Given the current forecast track and movement, no direct impacts are expected for Tampa Port Authority from this specific system.
