"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Virginia, VA, Port of within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities listed for the relevant locations in Virginia. Since the specific ""Virginia, VA, Port of"" is not listed, we need to consider nearby locations such as Norfolk, VA (Norfolk NAS) or other relevant Virginia ports.

For Norfolk NAS:
- Day 1: 2%
- Day 2: 4%
- Day 3: 9%
- Day 4: 11%
- Day 5: 2%

The cumulative probability is the sum of these probabilities:

2 + 4 + 9 + 4 = 19

So, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Virginia, VA, Port of within the next 5 days is approximately 19.",19%

"The cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Virginia, VA, Port of within the next 5 days is not directly provided in the table. However, we can infer that Virginia, VA, Port of is not listed separately. The closest relevant locations are Richmond, VA and Norfolk, VA. Since the exact location is not provided, we cannot determine the cumulative probability accurately from the given data.

If we were to estimate based on nearby locations, we would need to average the probabilities from Richmond and Norfolk. However, since the question specifies ""Virginia, VA, Port of,"" and this location is not explicitly listed, we cannot provide a precise answer.

Given the lack of specific data for ""Virginia, VA, Port of,"" we cannot provide a numerical answer.",70%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Virginia, VA, Port of within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities listed for the 34-kt wind arrival for each of the next five days and sum them up.

However, the provided data does not specify a particular ""Virginia, VA, Port of."" Instead, it lists probabilities for various locations in Virginia and other states. To proceed, we need to identify the relevant locations in Virginia and sum their probabilities for the 34-kt wind arrival.

The relevant locations in Virginia listed are:
- Norfolk, VA (assumed to be the Port of Virginia)
- Cape Henry, VA
- Virginia Beach, VA

Let's sum the probabilities for the 34-kt wind arrival for each of these locations over the next 5 days:

For Norfolk, VA (assuming it represents the Port of Virginia):
- Day 1: 52
- Day 2: 19
- Day 3: 7
- Day 4: 2
- Day 5: 1

For Cape Henry, VA:
- Day 1: 52
- Day 2: 19
- Day 3: 7
- Day 4: 2
- Day 5: 1

For Virginia Beach, VA:
- Day 1: 52
- Day 2: 19
- Day 3: 7
- Day 4: 2
- Day 5: 1

Since the probabilities for Norfolk, VA, Cape Henry, VA, and Virginia Beach, VA are identical, we can use any one of these sets of probabilities to represent the Port of Virginia.

Summing the probabilities for Norfolk, VA:
52 + 19 + 7 + 2 + 1 = 81

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Virginia, VA, Port of within the next 5 days is:

81",53%
"To find the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Virginia, VA, Port of within the next 5 days, we need to identify the relevant data points from the provided table. Since the specific location ""Virginia, VA, Port of"" is not listed, we will use the closest relevant locations: Norfolk, VA (which is often represented by Norfolk NAS or Oceana NAS in weather data).

From the table:
- Norfolk NAS, VA: 34-kt wind probabilities are 35, 33, 26, 22, 10
- Oceana NAS, VA: 34 probabilities are 35, 33,, 22, 10

Since the probabilities are cumulative over the next 5 days, we take the last value in the sequence, which represents the cumulative probability over the entire 5-day period.

The cumulative probability for Norfolk NAS, VA (representing Virginia, VA, Port of) is **35**.",55%

"To determine the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Virginia, VA, Port of within the next 5 days, we need to look at the relevant data points for Virginia, VA, Port of.

However, the provided data does not include a specific entry for ""Virginia, VA, Port of."" Instead, we need to consider the nearest relevant locations. The closest entries in the data are for Norfolk, VA, and other nearby locations like Norfolk NAS and Oceana NAS.

Given the absence of a direct entry, we can infer that the probability for Virginia, VA, Port of would be similar to that of Norfolk, VA. The data for Norfolk, VA, shows:

- Day 1: 0 (not listed)
- Day 2: 0 (not listed)
- Day 3: 0 (not listed)
- Day 4: 0 (not listed)
- Day 5: 0 (not listed)

Since there are no specific probabilities listed for Norfolk, VA, for the 50-kt wind arrival within the next 5 days, we can conclude that the cumulative probability is 0.

"The provided data does not include a specific entry for ""Virginia, VA, Port of."" However, we can consider the probabilities for nearby locations such as Norfolk, VA (Norfolk NAS) and Virginia Beach, VA (Oceana NAS) to estimate the cumulative probability.

For Norfolk NAS:

- Day 5: 0

For Oceana NAS:
- Day 1: 0

- Day 3: 0
- Day 4: 0
- Day 5: 0

Since the data does not provide any non-zero probabilities for the arrival of 50-kt winds within the next 5 days for these locations, we can infer that the cumulative probability for ""Virginia, VA, Port of"" is likely to be similar.

Therefore, the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Virginia, VA, Port of within the next 5 days is:

For Norfolk, VA (assuming it represents the Port of Virginia):

"To determine which forecasted time interval indicates the highest 34-kt wind probability for Virginia, VA, we need to examine the wind probabilities for the ports listed under Virginia:

1. Norfolk
2 Hampton Roads
3 Cape Henry
4 Virginia Beach

- **Norfolk**:
  - 0-12 hours: 1
  - 12-24 hours: 4
