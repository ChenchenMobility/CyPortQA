DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Grace was
located near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 76.1 West.  Grace is
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h). A general westward to
west-northwestward motion is expected for the next several days.  On
the forecast track, the center of Grace will move near or over 
Jamaica today.  Grace is forecast to move near the Cayman Islands 
tonight, and then approach the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico late 
Wednesday or early Thursday.
 
Reports from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next 
couple of days, and Grace could be near hurricane strength when it 
approaches the Yucatan coast of Mexico late Wednesday and early 
Thursday 

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
