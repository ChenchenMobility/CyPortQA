(This answer is based on the forecast track and wind probabilities indicating that Bermuda, where the port is located, will experience tropical-storm-force winds primarily on the third and fourth days, with some impact lingering into the fifth day. Given the storm's expected recurvature and movement away from Bermuda, port operations could potentially resume within a day after the storm's direct effects subside.)",5.0
