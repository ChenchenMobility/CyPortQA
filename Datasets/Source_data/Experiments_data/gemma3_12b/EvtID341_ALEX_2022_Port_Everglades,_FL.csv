"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory highlights potential impacts including storm surge, heavy rainfall, and possible tornadoes for the area including Port Everglades. Given the potential for significant disruption to port operations due to these factors, it's reasonable to assume a substantial impact on vessel traffic. Given the daily average, a disruption impacting 20 or more vessels is a plausible scenario for such an event.",C.
