"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **Event Duration:** The advisory indicates the most significant impacts will be felt ""tonight and on Saturday."" Let's assume ""tonight"" is roughly 6 hours and ""Saturday"" is 24 hours, totaling 30 hours.
*   **Port of Palm Beach District Impact:** The advisory mentions impacts to the ""East coast of Florida from the Volusia/Brevard County Line to Card Sound Bridge."" Palm Beach is within this area.
*   **Vessel Disruption:** Severe weather (like what's described) typically leads to port closures or significant delays, impacting vessel schedules.
*   **Estimating Disruption:** Given the storm's intensity and the area impacted, a significant disruption to port operations is likely. A full closure is possible, but let's assume a partial disruption, where some vessels are delayed or diverted.

Considering the likely disruption and duration, an estimate of **10-20 vessels** experiencing delays or diversions seems reasonable.

Therefore, the answer is **C. 10-20 vessels**.",A.
