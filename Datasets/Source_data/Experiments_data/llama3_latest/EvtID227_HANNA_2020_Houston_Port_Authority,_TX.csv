Rip currents are expected to become life-threatening along the Texas coast during the next couple of days due to swells generated by Hanna.,Hazardous surf and rip currents along ship channel approaches; isolated tornadoes within outer rain bands cannot be ruled out
Hazard:,Dangerous rip currents along upper Texas coast; brief tornadoes possible overnight into Saturday
Lightning strikes are possible within the warning area by tonight or Saturday morning.,High surf and dangerous rip currents; potential lightning and localized squalls affecting cargo handling operations.
Tornadoes and isolated power outages are possible due to the expected heavy cloudiness and strong low-level winds surrounding the tropical cyclone's landfall.,Dangerous surf and rip currents beginning Friday night.
"The Tropical Storm Watch issued for Port Mansfield to High Island, Texas, may also pose a risk of power outages and disruptions to port operations due to potential lightning strikes and strong electromagnetic pulses.",Dangerous surf and rip currents along Gulf beaches
