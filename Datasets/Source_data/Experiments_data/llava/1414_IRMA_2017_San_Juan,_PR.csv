As a result, it can be expected that there may be delays or suspensions of cargo operations at the affected ports for an extended period, possibly lasting several days as recovery efforts take place. The exact number of days cannot be determined without more information or specific details from the text.",2

"The image you have provided contains information about Hurricane Irma and its potential impact on various areas, including Florida Keys, the Bahamas, Cuba, and parts of the United States mainland. It discusses the storm surge, wind speeds, rainfall, and tornadoes associated with the hurricane.

In terms of the port's freight recovery, it is not possible to determine a specific number of days without additional context or information. The impact on the port's operations will depend on several factors, including the severity of the storm, damage to infrastructure, and any logistical challenges that may arise from recovery efforts.

If you can provide more details about the port in question and its potential exposure to Hurricane Irma, I may be able to offer a more informed answer.",2.0
