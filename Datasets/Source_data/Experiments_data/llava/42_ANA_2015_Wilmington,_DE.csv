"The image you've provided shows a forecast track cone for a tropical cyclone from the National Hurricane Center. However, the current position of the eye is not indicated on this map.

The map does show the projected path of the storm over time, with different positions marked as '09:00 PM EDT' (23:00 UTC), '12:00 AM EDT' (05:00 UTC), and '06:00 AM EDT' (14:00 UTC). The current position of the eye at 09:00 PM EDT is indicated as '32.4N, 77.6W', and it is marked on the map as a red dot.

Please note that for accurate information on storm tracks and potential impacts, you should consult official forecasts from the National Hurricane Center or your local weather service.","32.9N, 78.3W"
"The image provided by the National Hurricane Center does not show the exact position of the eye of the tropical cyclone at the time it was created. However, it shows a track forecast cone for the current storm, which indicates the potential path and intensity of the storm over time. If you need information on the current location or trajectory of a specific storm, you can visit the National Hurricane Center website or other reputable weather sources to find the most up-to-date information.","32.4N, 77.6W"

"The image you've shared appears to be a weather map showing Tropical Storm Ana. However, the format provided does not specify the coordinates of the current eye of the tropical cyclone. To determine the current location of the storm's eye, one would typically look for the area where the wind speeds are the highest and the central part of the storm. Without the latest weather information or an updated forecast from the National Hurricane Center, it is not possible to provide the current coordinates of the storm's eye based on this image alone.","31.6N, 77.8W"
"The image does not provide information on the current eye of the tropical cyclone. It shows a map with various elements such as the cyclone track forecast cone from National Hurricane Center, the storm's path, and some meteorological data points for temperature, dew point, and wind direction.

It forecasts that the storm will make landfall near the eastern seaboard of the United States, particularly in the coastal regions of Florida and the southeastern U.S. The affected areas are not explicitly named in the image, but one could reasonably infer that the ports in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland might be impacted by the storm's passage.
