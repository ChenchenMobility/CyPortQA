"The given text appears to be from a meteorological forecast or report, providing probabilities of different wind speeds for a certain region and time period. However, without additional context or information, it's not possible to directly calculate the cumulative probability of 50-kt (63 km/h) wind arrival at Canaveral Port District, FL within the next 5 days from this text alone.

To find the cumulative probability, you would need to consider the probabilities provided in the text and determine if any of those events include a wind speed of 50 kt or higher within the next 5 days. For example, you might look for the probability of a 63 km/h wind event (50 kt) occurring at least once within the next 5 days and add up all such probabilities to get the cumulative probability.
