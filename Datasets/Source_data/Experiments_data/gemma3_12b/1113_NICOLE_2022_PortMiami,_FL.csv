**Reasoning:**

The advisory explicitly states that Nicole is expected to impact the east coast of Florida. PortMiami is located on the east coast of Florida. Given the predicted heavy rainfall and potential storm surge, significant disruptions to port operations are likely. The advisory's mention of impacts to the ""immediate coast"" suggests a potentially widespread impact, likely exceeding the average daily vessel count.",A.

,"All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
,Vessels that want to stay in port must obtain Captain-of-the-Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to off-load and depart at least 24 h before hazardous winds should divert to another port.

,Vessels that want to stay in port must obtain Captain-of-the-Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to off-load and depart at least 24 h before hazardous winds should divert to another port.
"Given the hurricane warning and potential for storm surge, PortMiami should prepare for potential operational disruptions, including heightened security, potential closure, and preparations for securing cargo and infrastructure. It's crucial to closely monitor updates and follow instructions from port authorities and emergency management officials.","Ports and facilities should minimize the number of vessels in port, prepare for drawbridge closures by 20:00, and ensure readiness for sustained winds within 24 hours."
,Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and may continue all transfer operations while Condition WHISKEY is in effect.

,Vessels that want to stay in port must obtain Captain-of-the-Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to off-load and depart at least 24 h before hazardous winds should divert to another port.
"Given the imminent threat of Subtropical Storm Nicole and the potential for hazardous weather conditions, PortMiami will likely implement restrictions on vessel traffic, potentially including a slowdown of operations, restrictions on vessel size, and possible temporary closures to ensure safety. Expect guidance to prioritize the safe maneuvering of vessels and potentially suspend some activities until the storm passes.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
"Given the active subtropical storm warning and potential for significant storm surge and heavy rainfall, ocean-going and commercial vessel activity at PortMiami will likely be restricted or suspended for at least the next 12 hours, prioritizing safety and minimizing potential damage from adverse weather conditions. Expect delays and potential rerouting of vessels until the storm passes and conditions improve.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."

"Given the forecast for Nicole approaching the Florida coast with potential for tropical storm conditions, commercial vessel activity at PortMiami will likely be significantly restricted or suspended for a period, prioritizing safety and minimizing risk from high winds and potential storm surge. Expect delays, reroutings, and possible temporary closures until the storm passes and conditions stabilize.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
,"Ports and facilities should minimize the number of vessels in port, prepare for drawbridge closures by 20:00, and ensure readiness for sustained winds within 24 hours."
"Given the potential for hurricane conditions and storm surge impacting the area within 24 hours, PortMiami will likely experience operational restrictions, including potential closures or reduced vessel traffic, to ensure safety and prevent damage. Facility personnel will be focused on securing assets and preparing for potential impacts.","Ports and facilities should minimize the number of vessels in port, prepare for drawbridge closures by 20:00, and ensure readiness for sustained winds within 24 hours."
