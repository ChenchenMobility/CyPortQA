HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Destin Florida to the Mississippi-Alabama border...1 to 2 ft.
Mississippi-Alabama border to the Mouth of Mississippi River...2 to
4 ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Louisiana-Texas border...1 to
2 ft.

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

RAINFALL:  The disturbance is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches over the central and northwestern
Bahamas, the Florida Keys, and South Florida through early Tuesday.
Isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches are possible over the southern
Florida peninsula.  This rainfall may cause flooding.  The
disturbance is expected to produce heavy rainfall along the central
Gulf Coast of the United States by the middle of the week.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by late Tuesday.  Tropical-storm-force wind gusts will be
possible today across portions of South Florida and the Florida
Keys.
