"To determine the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at the Port of Savannah, GA within the next 5 days, you need to identify the relevant data from the table. The Port of Savannah, GA, is not directly listed, but we can use the closest relevant data points, such as Waycross, GA (WCRS) or Brunswick, GA (BQKN).

However, since these specific locations are not provided in the table, we need to infer from the closest available data points. The closest data points are:

- Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (SAV (SAV)
- Brunswick, GA (BQKN)

Since SAV is not listed, we use BQKN as a proxy. The cumulative probability for BQKN at 34-kt winds is:

0.4 (or 40%)

Thus, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at the Port of Savannah, GA within the next 5 within the next 5 days is:

40

(Note: This is an inference based on the assumption that Brunswick, GA, is a reasonable proxy for the Port of Savannah, GA.)",60%

"The data provided does not include specific entries for Port of Savannah, GA. However, the closest location mentioned in the data is ""Waycross, GA,"" which might serve as a proxy for Port of Savannah due to their geographical proximity.

For Waycross, GA, the probabilities for the 34-kt wind are as follows:
- 0-12 hours: Not provided
- 12-24 hours: Not provided
- 24-48 hours: Not provided
- 48 hours or more: Not provided

Since the data for Waycross, GA does not provide specific probabilities for the 34-kt wind, we cannot determine the highest probability interval based on the provided data. However, if we consider the nearest available data, which is for ""Waycross, GA,"" it seems the data is incomplete for making this determination.

Given the incomplete data indicates that Waycross, GA is not explicitly listed, thus we cannot derive the answer from the given data. If we were to use the closest location, Waycross, GA, we would still not have the necessary data to answer the question. Therefore, based on the provided information, the question cannot be accurately answered.",C.
"The forecast for the Port of Savannah, GA (Zayton, GA) isn't directly listed in the provided data. However, Zayton, GA, is near Savannah, GA. The closest data points are likely ""Zayton, GA"" or ""Savannah, GA."" Since ""Zayton, GA"" isn't listed, we'll use ""Columbus, GA"" as a proxy, given its relative proximity.

For Columbus, GA (34 kt winds):
- 0-12 hours: X
- 12-24: X
- 24-48: 2
- 48+: 4

The highest probability for 34-kt winds is in Columbus, GA is in the interval of 48 hours or more.
