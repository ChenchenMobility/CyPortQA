Isolated tornadoes are possible today and overnight over parts of the upper Texas and Louisiana coasts.,Dangerous rip currents and high surf along Louisiana beaches; minor river rises possible on the lower Mississippi due to heavy rain
"Tornadoes are possible within 24 hours along the upper Texas and Louisiana Coasts, which may impact Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA.",Isolated brief tornadoes possible across southeast Louisiana; hazardous surf and rip currents along the Louisiana coastline
Tornadoes and isolated tornado watches may be issued for areas around the port as Hanna's outer rain bands interact with the region's land-sea contrast.,"Dangerous surf and rip currents along the Louisiana coast, localized flash-flood potential in low-lying areas"
"Flooding in low-lying areas and potential disruptions to maritime operations due to strong rip currents and rough seas affecting the navigation channels and berths at Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA.",Long-period swells and elevated river levels could create navigation restrictions for deep-draft vessels on the lower Mississippi River.
"Tornadoes are possible as the tropical cyclone's outer rain bands interact with the region's instability, posing a risk to vessel operations in the port area.",Increased swells and dangerous rip currents along Louisiana Gulf approaches; possible river level rises on the lower Mississippi from runoff.
Isolated tornadoes may occur over the port area due to the outer rain bands of the tropical cyclone.,Gusty squalls may affect marine traffic on the lower Mississippi River; increased river currents and reduced visibility in heavy rain.
