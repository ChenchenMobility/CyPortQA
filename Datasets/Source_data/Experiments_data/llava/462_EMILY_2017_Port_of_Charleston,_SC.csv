"The table does not provide specific probabilities for the Port of Charleston, SC. It only shows the probabilities for certain locations along the coast of Florida and North Carolina. However, based on the given table, if you need a cumulative probability for 34-kt wind arrival within the next 5 days at any location, you should add up the individual time period probabilities (ONSET PROBABILITY) from 06Z MON to 06Z FRI, and then add up the cumulative probability values shown in the table.

For example, if you sum up the probabilities for Charleston, SC within the next 5 days for each hour of the forecast period (from 18Z Mon to 06Z Fri), you should get the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Port of Charleston, SC within the next 5 days.",≈15%
