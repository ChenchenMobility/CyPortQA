The depression is moving toward the west near 21 mph (33 km/h), and
a westward motion is expected to continue through this evening.  A

forward speed is forecast tonight and Friday, with a general 
northwest motion continuing through at least Sunday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of the system will move near or just 
north of the northeastern coast of Honduras and the Bay Islands on 
Friday and will approach the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of 
Mexico on Saturday.  The center is then expected to cross the 
Yucatan Peninsula Saturday night and move into the south-central 
Gulf of Mexico on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and the 
depression is expected to become a tropical storm later today or 
tonight.  The system could be near or at hurricane strength when it 
reaches the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico late Saturday.
