At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Josephine was
located near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 56.1 West. Josephine is
moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days
followed by a turn toward the northwest late this weekend or early
next week.  On the forecast track, the center of Josephine is
expected to pass to the northeast of the Leeward Islands over the
weekend.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Slight strengthening is possible tonight.
After that, Josephine is expected to weaken over the weekend as it
encounters unfavorable upper-level winds.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
mainly to the north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane
Hunter aircraft is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

RAINFALL: Josephine is expected to cause storm-total rainfall of
