"Based on the track forecast cone, wind probability forecast graphic product, future wind probability table and cyclone public advisory from the National Hurricane Center, I estimate the impact of Hurricane Rosa on the port as follows:

* Port Yuma AZ: 0 days
* Ensenada: 0 days
* Is Guadalupe: 2 days
* Punta Eugenia: 3 days
* Abreojos: 1 day
* Penasco: 1 day
* Bahia Kino: 1 day

Assuming the port's freight is mostly affected by wind and rain, I estimate that it will take around 1-3 days for the port to recover from the storm, depending on the location. However, please note that this is just an estimate based on the provided data, and actual recovery time may vary.",3.0
