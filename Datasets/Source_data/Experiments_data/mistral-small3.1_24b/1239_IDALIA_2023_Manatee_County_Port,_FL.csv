"The cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days is not directly provided in the data. However, based on the information for nearby locations, we can infer:

- **Tampa FL (50-kt winds)**:
  - Day 1: 16%
  - Day 2: 16%
  - Cumulative: 16% + 16% = 32%

Since Manatee County Port is geographically close to Tampa, we can use this as an approximation.

"The provided data does not include specific probabilities for Manatee County Port, FL. However, we can use the data for nearby locations to estimate the probability. The closest relevant data points are for Tampa FL and Cedar Key FL can be used for an estimation.

For Tampa FL:
- Day 3: 33%
- Day 4: 17%

For Cedar Key FL:
- Day 3: 23%
- Day 4: 37%

To estimate the probability for Manatee County Port, FL, we can take the average of these probabilities:

\[
\text{Average probability} = \frac{(33\% + 17\% + 23\% + 37\%)}{4} = \frac{110}{4} = 27.5\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the cumulative probability is approximately 28.",50%
"The data provided does not include specific probabilities for Manatee County Port, FL. However, it does include probabilities for nearby locations such as Tampa FL and Cedar Key FL. To estimate the cumulative probability for Manatee County Port, FL, we can consider the probabilities for these nearby locations.

For Tampa FL:
- 50-kt wind arrival probabilities: 3%, 29%, and X% for the next 5 days.

For Cedar Key FL:
- 50-kt wind arrival probabilities: 1%, 40%, and X% for the next 5 days.

Given that Manatee County Port, FL is located between Tampa FL and Cedar Key FL, a reasonable estimate for the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days could be an average of the probabilities for Tampa FL and Cedar Key FL.

Let's calculate the average of the non-zero probabilities for Tampa FL and Cedar Key FL:

Tampa FL: 3% + 29% = 32%
Cedar Key FL: 1% + 40% = 41%

Average: (32% + 41%) / 2 = 36.5%

Since we need to provide a single number, we can round this to the nearest whole number:

"To determine the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days, we need to identify the relevant data from the provided table. Manatee County Port, FL is not explicitly listed, but we can use nearby locations to estimate the probability. Tampa, FL is a close proxy.

From the table:
- Tampa, FL (50 kt winds):

"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for Manatee County Port, FL, we need to identify the location of Manatee County Port in the provided data. However, Manatee County Port is not explicitly listed. Therefore, we will refer to the nearest relevant locations: Bradenton and Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport.

The closest entries in the data are for Bradenton and Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport. Let's examine the probabilities for these locations:

For Bradenton:
- 0-12 hours: 4
- 12-24 hours: 56
- 24-48 hours: 35
- 48 hours or more: 1

For Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport:
- 0-12 hours: 4
- 12-24 hours: 56
-56
- 24-48 hours: 35
-35
- 48 hours or more: 1

From the data, the highest probability is highest in the 12-24 hours interval.

Therefore, the answer is:

B. 12-24 Hours",C.
"The forecasted time interval indicating the highest 34-kt wind probability for Manatee County Port, FL is:

C. 24-48 hours",D.
"The forecast for Manatee County Port, FL isn't directly listed, but Tampa, FL, is the nearest relevant location. For Tampa, FL, the highest 34-kt wind probability is in the 24-48 hours interval is 47.

Therefore, the answer is the highest probability.

So, the answer is:
C. 24-48 hours",D.
"The table does not provide direct information for Manatee County Port, FL. However, we can look at nearby locations for relevant data. Bradenton, FL, which is in Manatee County, shows the following probabilities for 34-kt winds:

- 12-24 hours: X
- 24-48 hours: 10
- 48 hours or more: 15

Based on the data for Bradenton, the highest 34-kt wind probability is in the interval:
