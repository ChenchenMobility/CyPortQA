DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Grace was located
near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 84.9 West. Grace is moving
toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A general
west-northwestward to westward motion is expected for the next
several days.  On the forecast track, Grace is expected to make
landfall in the eastern Yucatan Peninsula Thursday morning, move
over the Yucatan Peninsula on Thursday, and move over the southwest
Gulf of Mexico Thursday night or early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is possible before the center of Grace
reaches the Yucatan Peninsula.  Weakening will occur while the
center moves over the Yucatan Peninsula on Thursday, with
restrengthening expected when Grace moves over the southwest Gulf of
Mexico on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).  NOAA buoy 40256, located west of the center, 
recently reported sustained winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) and a wind 
gust of 51 mph (83 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve and 
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft data is 989 mb (29.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Grace can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages.
 
WIND:  Strong gusty winds are likely over portions of the Cayman
Islands for the next few hours.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible along the southern coast of Cuba within the watch area for
the next several hours.  Hurricane conditions are expected within
the warning area in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico late tonight or
early Thursday, with tropical storm conditions beginning as early as
this evening.
 
RAINFALL:
The system is expected to produce the following rainfall amounts:
 
Over the Cayman Islands and central to northern portions of the
Yucatan Peninsula, 4 to 8 inches of rain with isolated maximum
totals of 12 inches are expected through Friday.  Heavy rainfall
from Grace will likely result in areas of flash and urban flooding
 
Over the central to northern Veracruz state of Mexico, 5 to 10
inches of rain with isolated maximum totals of 15 inches are
expected from Friday through Sunday.  Heavy rainfall from Grace will
likely result in areas of flash and urban flooding, and will also be
capable of producing mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by as
much as 3 to 5 ft above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast near and to the north of where the center makes landfall in
the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula late tonight or early Thursday.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Grace will spread westward from Jamaica
and the Cayman Islands to the southern coast of Cuba and the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico through Thursday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
