River flooding and potential tornadoes are additional hazards.,"Low tornado threat remains east of the track, therefore minimal for Port Arthur"
Tornadoes.,Isolated brief tornado threat within rain bands; lightning and reduced visibilities may intermittently halt cargo and bunkering operations.
Potential for localized flooding and disruption of maritime traffic due to potential tidal influence and debris.,Isolated tornado threat mainly east of the port; elevated seas and short-period swells may disrupt vessel movements and lightering operations
