Rip currents are also a hazard.,None of operational significance expected at Port Arthur
Tornadoes.,"Elevated seas and rip currents in the near-shore approaches, but no major operational hazards expected"
Rip currents will pose a significant hazard.,"Marginal threat of isolated brief tornadoes in outer rain-bands if the track shifts west, but overall risk is low"
Tornadoes,Isolated brief tornadoes possible in outer rainbands if the center passes slightly farther west
