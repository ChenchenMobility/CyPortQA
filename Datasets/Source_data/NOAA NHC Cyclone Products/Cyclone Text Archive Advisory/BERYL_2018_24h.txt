DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 12.9 North, longitude 53.5 West.  Beryl is
moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A
west-northwestward motion with an increase in forward speed is
expected during the next few days.  On the forecast track, the
center of Beryl will approach the Lesser Antilles through Sunday,
cross the island chain Sunday night, and move south of the Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico on Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are estimated to be near 50 mph (85 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours,
and Beryl is likely to weaken to a tropical depression after moving
across the Lesser Antilles.  The system could degenerate into an
open trough by the time it reaches the central Caribbean Sea and
Hispaniola Monday night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in Dominica and
Guadeloupe Sunday night.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in
the watch areas of the Lesser Antilles by late Sunday or Monday.

RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
2 to 4 inches through Monday across the southern Leeward and
northern Windward Islands.  Across the remainder of the Leeward and
Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, rainfall
amounts of 1 to 2 inches with locally higher amounts are expected.
