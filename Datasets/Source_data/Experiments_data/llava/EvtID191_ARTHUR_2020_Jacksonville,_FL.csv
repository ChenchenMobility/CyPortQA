"The image depicts a tropical storm track and intensity map for Tropical Storm Arthur. It indicates that the storm is currently over the Atlantic Ocean near the eastern coast of Florida, and it's expected to move northwest. The storm's wind speed is forecast to increase over the next 24 hours before decreasing as it moves away from the coastal areas.

The map also includes a forecast track for the storm, showing its projected path over the next few days. The colors on the map represent different intensities of the storm: white represents wind speeds between 34 and 57 mph, while green indicates wind speeds above 57 mph.

The specific details of the expected start of impact on freight at Jacksonville, FL are not visible in this image. The image focuses on the storm track and intensity, rather than providing information about freight operations at a particular location. For current and future weather conditions affecting Jacksonville or other areas, it would be best to consult real-time weather forecasts provided by local meteorological agencies or services.",None
