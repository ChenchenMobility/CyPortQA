"Tornadoes are a potential hazard associated with the future storm at Ottawa Port District, IL.",Minor river rises and localized ponding on terminals; marginal risk of an embedded tornado can’t be ruled out but threat is low this far north
Tornadoes are possible in the region.,Brief river-rise and minor flash-flood risk in low-lying areas; marginal tornado threat south of the port but very low directly at Ottawa
Surf and rip current conditions.,"Minor river-level rises possible downstream on the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, but no significant port disruption anticipated"
Surf and rip current conditions.,Minor river rises and localized flooding possible along the Illinois River channels near the port.
Tornadoes may be a hazard associated with the possible future storm.,Potential for localized river flooding along the Illinois River due to upstream heavy rainfall in the Mississippi Valley.
Tornadoes are a potential hazard.,Brief lightning and localized visibility reductions in heavy rain showers could disrupt barge and lock operations.
Potential hazards could include disruptions to shipping and port operations.,Brief spin-up tornadoes and localized flash flooding cannot be ruled out as the remnant circulation passes
"There are no additional hazards associated with the possible future storm at Ottawa Port District, IL, excluding rainfall, wind, and storm surge.",Potential navigation restrictions on the Illinois River if upstream rainfall raises river levels
"There are no additional hazards associated with the possible future storm at Ottawa Port District, IL, excluding rainfall, wind, and storm surge.",Potential for temporary river-current rise and operational delays due to heavy rain and embedded thunderstorms; otherwise minimal tropical-cyclone hazards expected
"There are no additional hazards associated with the possible future storm at Ottawa Port District, IL, excluding rainfall, wind, and storm surge.",None
