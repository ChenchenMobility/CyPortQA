"Based on the information provided, I would assign Port of Brunswick, GA's condition under tropical cyclone as:

D. YANKEE

Explanation: According to the advisory, a Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for the Gulf coast of Florida south of Englewood to Chokoloskee, and for the Dry Tortugas. Since Port of Brunswick is located in Georgia, which is not directly affected by the watch or warning areas mentioned in the advisory, it would fall under the category of ""Normal"" weather conditions. However, since Idalia is expected to produce heavy rainfall and strong winds that may affect parts of southern Georgia, I would categorize Port of Brunswick's condition as ""YANKEE"", which means a tropical cyclone watch or warning has been issued for an area within 36 hours.",C.

D. YANKEE",D.
"Based on the information provided, I would assign the Port of Brunswick, GA's condition under tropical cyclone at the time as:

"Based on the information provided, I would assign the Port of Brunswick, GA's condition under tropical cyclone as:

B. WHISKEY

Reason: The Port of Brunswick, GA is located in the Southeastern United States and is not directly affected by Tropical Depression Ten's current position. However, according to the discussion and outlook section, heavy rainfall is expected to impact portions of the Gulf Coast and Southeast by mid- to late next week. This suggests that the port may be influenced by the outer rain bands or indirect effects from the tropical cyclone.",B.

"Based on the forecasted track and intensity of Hurricane Idalia, general vessel activity at Port of Brunswick, GA should exercise extreme caution and consider halting operations until further notice. The port's proximity to the storm's expected landfall and potential for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas warrants a heightened level of alertness and preparedness.","Mariners are reminded there are no safe havens in port; ports are safest when the inventory of vessels is at a minimum, and all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures."
"The current operational guidance for general vessel activity at the Port of Brunswick, GA suggests that vessels should exercise caution when operating in the area, as tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on Wednesday and potentially impact the port. Vessels should monitor weather forecasts and updates from local authorities to ensure safe passage through the area.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must obtain Captain of the Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan.
"No specific guidance is suggested for general vessel activity at Port of Brunswick, GA due to Tropical Storm Idalia's forecast track keeping it away from the area. Vessels operating in the vicinity should monitor updates and be aware of any potential impacts from tropical storm-force winds and rough seas within 150 miles of the storm center.","Vessels that wish to remain in port must obtain permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia or Florida that cannot safely off-load and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should divert to an alternate port."
"Based on the current weather conditions, I would suggest that the Port of Brunswick, GA should consider issuing a warning to vessels in the area to prepare for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and potential flooding due to Hurricane Idalia's landfall expected on Wednesday. Vessels should be advised to take necessary precautions to ensure safe navigation and avoid any hazards posed by storm surges, rip currents, and reduced visibility.","Mariners are reminded there are no safe havens in port; ports are safest when the inventory of vessels is at a minimum, and all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures."
"Based on the current situation, it is recommended to suspend all non-essential vessel operations and consider delaying or diverting vessels from entering the Port of Brunswick, GA, as Hurricane Idalia is expected to bring life-threatening storm surge, strong winds, and heavy rainfall to the area. Additionally, commercial vessels should prepare for potential disruptions in port facilities and services.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must obtain Captain of the Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan.
"Based on the current weather conditions and forecasts, it is suggested that ocean-going and commercial vessels avoid or limit their activities in the vicinity of the Port of Brunswick, GA, as Tropical Storm Idalia's outer rain bands are expected to impact the area, potentially causing rough seas, strong winds, and reduced visibility.","Vessels that wish to remain in port must obtain permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia or Florida that cannot safely off-load and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should divert to an alternate port."
"Given the forecasted track of Hurricane Idalia, which includes a potential landfall near or along the coast of Georgia, it is recommended that the Port of Brunswick, GA takes necessary precautions to prepare for potential storm impacts, such as shutting down operations and securing facilities by Wednesday morning at the latest. Additionally, port and facility operators should closely monitor updates from the National Weather Service and local authorities for further guidance on storm surges, flooding, and other hazards that may affect the area.","Port Condition Yankee is in effect; facilities should anticipate sustained winds within 24 hours, reduce vessel inventory, secure operations, stay off the water, secure belongings, and be prepared for evacuation and coastal flooding."
"Based on the information provided, it appears that the Port of Brunswick, GA may be impacted by Tropical Storm Idalia's outer rain bands and possible flooding from storm surge. Current operational guidance suggests that port and facility operations should prepare for potential disruptions, including possible shutdowns or restrictions to ensure safety and minimize damage.",Ports and facilities are open to all commercial traffic and may continue all transfer operations while Condition X-Ray is in effect.
"No direct impact from Hurricane Idalia is expected at the Port of Brunswick, GA, as it is located outside the Tropical Storm Warning area and beyond the storm's forecast track.
