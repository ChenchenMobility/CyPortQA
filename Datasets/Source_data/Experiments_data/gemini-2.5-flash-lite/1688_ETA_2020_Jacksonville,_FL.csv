"The provided table does not list ""Jacksonville, FL"". However, it does list ""Mayport NS FL"", which is in close proximity to Jacksonville and often experiences similar weather conditions.

Let's analyze the probabilities for ""Mayport NS FL"" for sustained winds of at least 34 kt:

*   **0-12 hours (12Z TUE to 00Z WED):** X (less than 1%)
*   **12-24 Hours (00Z WED to 12Z WED):** X (less than 1%)
*   **24-48 hours (12Z WED to 00Z THU):** 1% (Onset Probability), 1% (Cumulative Probability)
*   **48 hours or more (00Z THU to 12Z SAT and beyond):**
    *   00Z THU to 12Z THU: 1% (Onset)
    *   12Z THU to 12Z FRI: 1% (Onset)
    *   12Z FRI to 12Z SAT: X (Onset)

The highest probability of at least 34 kt winds occurring during a specific interval for Mayport NS FL is 1%, which appears in the 24-48 hour interval (12Z WED to 00Z THU).

Therefore, considering Mayport NS FL as a proxy for Jacksonville, FL:
