"The data provided does not include information for Wilmington, DE. Therefore, based on the information given, the answer cannot be determined.

However, if we were to infer from the structure of the data provided (which includes multiple locations and probabilities of 34-kt winds), we would look for the earliest time frame where the probability rises above zero. Since Wilmington, DE is not listed, we cannot provide a specific answer from the choices given.

If you need to make an educated guess based on typical weather patterns or similar locations, you might consider that coastal areas often see rising probabilities of high winds sooner rather than later. But without specific data, it's purely speculative.

Given the options and the lack of data for Wilmington, DE, the most accurate response is that the question cannot be answered with the information provided.",D.
