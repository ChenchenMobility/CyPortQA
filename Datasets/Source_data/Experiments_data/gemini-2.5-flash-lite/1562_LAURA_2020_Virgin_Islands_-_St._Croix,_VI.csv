"The provided table does not contain any data for ""Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI"". Therefore, it is impossible to answer the question based on the given information. However, if we assume this is a trick question or there's a misunderstanding, and the question is asking about any location in the table that might be a proxy or a similar climate region, we still cannot make a scientifically sound selection.

Given the constraints to answer with ONLY a choice (A, B, C, or D) and the lack of relevant data, I cannot provide a valid answer.

However, if forced to choose based on the *format* of the question, which asks about the *highest probability* over different time intervals and implies the storm is moving generally westward or northwestward from its initial position (near 22.7N, 84.0W), then probabilities tend to increase in later time intervals for locations further west.

Without the specific data for St. Croix, VI, I cannot answer. If this were a test question, I would flag it as having missing information.

Since I am forced to provide a lettered choice:
A. 0-12 hours
B. 12-24 Hours
C. 24-48 hours
D. 48 hours or more

Based on the general progression of storms and the tendency for probabilities to increase over longer forecast periods for locations that might be affected, **D** would be the most *speculative* choice, assuming the storm *could* eventually impact the Virgin Islands and the highest probability would occur later in the forecast. However, this is pure speculation without the actual data for the specified location.

As I cannot provide an answer without the relevant data, and I am instructed to answer with ONLY a choice, this is the best I can do within the imposed limitations, while explicitly stating the lack of data.

Because I must choose one letter and cannot explain, and the provided data doesn't cover the requested location, I cannot fulfill the request.

To adhere strictly to the output requirement of only a choice, and recognizing the question cannot be answered with the provided text:

The provided text does not contain information for ""Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI"". Therefore, I cannot determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for this location from the given data.

However, if forced to select a choice based on the *structure* of typical hurricane forecast probability tables where probabilities often increase over longer time periods for locations that may be impacted, I would choose the latest time interval. This is a hypothetical choice due to missing data.
