"The question asks for the *expected landfall location* if the storm continues at its current speed and direction. The provided image is a ""Tropical-Storm-Force Wind Speed Probabilities"" graphic, which shows the probability of experiencing tropical-storm-force winds over a 120-hour period. It indicates the storm's potential path and the associated wind probabilities but does not show a single, definitive landfall location or a current speed and direction that can be used to predict one.

Therefore, based *only* on the provided graphic, it is not possible to determine a specific expected landfall location. The graphic shows a cone of probability for wind impacts, not a single track or predicted landfall point. The question is unanswerable with the given information.

However, if I must provide an answer based on interpreting a *likely* landfall area suggested by the highest probabilities and the general track depicted, the storm appears to be heading towards the Lesser Antilles.

If I am forced to give a single location name, based on the visual cue of where the higher probabilities of wind speed overlap with landmasses, the most likely general area is the Lesser Antilles. However, the question asks for *the* expected landfall location, which implies a specific point. Since the graphic does not provide this, I cannot definitively answer with a specific location name.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location name based on the image. If the question is intended to ask about general impact zones based on the highest probabilities, then the Lesser Antilles is the most prominent landmass in the path of the higher probability wind speeds.

Given the strict constraint of answering *only* with the name of the impacted coast, and that the graphic shows probabilities of wind reaching land, I will interpret the question as asking for the most likely general coastal region indicated by the highest wind speed probabilities.
