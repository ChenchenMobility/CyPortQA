,"All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
"Given the Hurricane Watch and Storm Surge Watch for Port Everglades, general vessel activity should be restricted and preparations made for potential adverse conditions, including securing vessels and monitoring updates from the National Weather Service. Vessels should defer non-essential movements and be prepared for potential delays or restrictions based on evolving forecasts.",Vessels that want to stay in port must obtain Captain-of-the-Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to off-load and depart at least 24 h before hazardous winds should divert to another port.
,"All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
"Given the Hurricane Watch and Storm Surge Watch issued for Port Everglades, commercial vessels should closely monitor weather updates and prepare for potential disruptions to port operations, potentially including securing cargo and adjusting schedules. It's advisable to consult with port authorities for specific guidance and potential restrictions.",Vessels that want to stay in port must obtain Captain-of-the-Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to off-load and depart at least 24 h before hazardous winds should divert to another port.
"Given the Hurricane Warning and potential for significant storm surge and rainfall, Port Everglades should prepare for potential operational disruptions, likely including heightened security, potential closures, and a focus on securing cargo and infrastructure. It's crucial to monitor the latest advisories and follow directives from local authorities and the U.S. Coast Guard.","Ports and facilities should minimize the number of vessels in port, prepare for drawbridge closures by 20:00, and ensure readiness for sustained winds within 24 hours."
,Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and may continue all transfer operations while Condition WHISKEY is in effect.
,"All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
"Given the Hurricane Watch and Storm Surge Watch issued for Port Everglades, vessel activity will likely be significantly restricted or suspended within the next 24 hours. Expect port authorities to issue guidance limiting or halting operations to ensure safety, potentially including berthing restrictions and delays in vessel arrivals and departures.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."

,"All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
"Given the warnings for storm surge, tropical storm conditions, and large swells, ocean-going and commercial vessels at Port Everglades will likely experience restricted access, potential delays, and possibly be advised to remain in port for safety until the storm passes and conditions improve. Operations will likely be heavily monitored and adjusted based on evolving weather reports.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
"Given the Hurricane Watch and potential for storm surge, ocean-going and commercial vessels at Port Everglades will likely be advised to seek safe harbor or anchor offshore to avoid potential hazards. Operational guidance will likely involve restrictions on vessel movement and potential delays until the storm passes and conditions improve.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."

"Given the Tropical Storm Warning and potential for storm surge and heavy rainfall, Port Everglades will likely experience operational disruptions, including potential closures or restricted access, as facility personnel prioritize securing assets and ensuring safety. Expect delays in vessel traffic and cargo handling as the port adjusts to the storm's impact over the next 12 hours.","Ports and facilities should minimize the number of vessels in port, prepare for drawbridge closures by 20:00, and ensure readiness for sustained winds within 24 hours."
,"Ports and facilities should minimize the number of vessels in port, prepare for drawbridge closures by 20:00, and ensure readiness for sustained winds within 24 hours."
"Given the advisory indicating Subtropical Storm Nicole is expected to approach the northwestern Bahamas and Florida's east coast, Port Everglades will likely implement heightened operational readiness measures within the next 12 hours. This will probably include increased monitoring of weather conditions, potential restrictions on vessel traffic, and adjustments to cargo handling to prepare for potential disruptions.",Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and may continue all transfer operations while Condition WHISKEY is in effect.
"Given the forecast for Subtropical Storm Nicole bringing potential tropical storm conditions and heavy rainfall to the northwestern Bahamas and approaching Florida's east coast, Port Everglades will likely implement operational guidance including restricted vessel movement, potential temporary closures, and heightened security measures to ensure safety and minimize disruptions. Anticipate restrictions on cargo operations and potential delays as the storm nears.","Ports and facilities should minimize the number of vessels in port, prepare for drawbridge closures by 20:00, and ensure readiness for sustained winds within 24 hours."
