A tornado will be possible.,Localized flash-flood risk in low-lying and urban areas due to heavy rain bands
Rip Currents,"A low-end risk of brief, weak inland tornadoes cannot be ruled out if remnant Fred tracks close to the Mid-Atlantic, but the probability at the port is very low."
Rip currents,Minor river or urban flooding possible if local heavy downpours occur mid-week
Rip currents,"Minor river or urban flooding possible if heavy showers align with high tide, otherwise operational impacts limited"
Tornadoes may be possible.,None anticipated that would affect port operations during the forecast period.
Tornadoes and Rough Surf,Isolated tornado risk remains confined to Florida; not applicable to New Jersey
Tornadoes may occur.,Minor river/urban flooding possible if locally heavy rain bands reach Delaware Valley; otherwise no significant hazards for port operations
Coastal Flooding,Minor river rises or localized ponding possible if remnants pass nearby
Rip Currents,None
The possible future storm may cause rip currents.,None
