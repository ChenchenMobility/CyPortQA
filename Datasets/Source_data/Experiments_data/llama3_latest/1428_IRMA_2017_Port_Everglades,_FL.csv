This is a forecast issued by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the first line (""ZCZC MIAPWSAT1 ALL"") indicates that this is a Tropical Weather Outlook for the Atlantic Ocean.

To find the peak 34-kt wind probability at Port Everglades, FL over the next 5 days, you would need to read through the entire text and extract the relevant information. However, I can suggest some possible steps:

1. Look for a section titled ""Port Everglades, FL"" or something similar.
2. Check if there is a table or chart that displays wind probabilities for different locations over the next 5 days.
3. If you find such a table or chart, look for the column labeled ""34-kt wind probability"" and identify the peak value for Port Everglades, FL.
