The next complete advisory will be issued at 1000 PM CDT (0200 UTC), which is on Saturday, June 4th, 2022. It is possible that the storm track and intensity may change between now and then, so it would be best to monitor updates from the National Hurricane Center for any changes in the forecast or advisories.",6/3/2022

The expected end of impact on freight at Canaveral Port District, FL cannot be determined from this image alone, as the forecast only provides information up until the next complete advisory, which is scheduled for 1000 PM CDT (0000 UTC). The specific date and time when the impact on freight will end would depend on the development of the storm and its eventual track.
