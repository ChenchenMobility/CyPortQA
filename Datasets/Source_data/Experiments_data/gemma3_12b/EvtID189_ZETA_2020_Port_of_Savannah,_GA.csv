"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The provided text discusses Hurricane Zeta's impacts, including rainfall and potential for flooding across a wide area, extending to the Mid-Atlantic region. Savannah, GA, falls within this general area of potential impact. The text doesn’t provide a precise number of vessels affected at Port of Savannah. However, given the severity of the storm and potential for disruptions to port operations due to high winds, heavy rain, and potential storm surge, it's reasonable to assume a significant number of vessels would be impacted. The phrase ""significant number"" aligns with the choice ""20 vessels or more.""",A.
D. 20 vessels or more,A.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

*   **Zeta's Impact:** The advisory explicitly mentions ""an initial area of heavy rains will begin to impact the central Gulf Coast tonight, spreading north into the Tennessee Valley on Wednesday."" Savannah, GA, falls within this area of predicted impact.
*   **Disruption:** Heavy rainfall and potential for strong winds will likely cause delays and disruptions to port operations.
*   **Conservative Estimate:** Even a conservative estimate considering potential delays and disruptions suggests a significant impact exceeding the average daily vessel count. Given that the area is expected to experience impacts that disrupt operations, it's reasonable to expect more than 20 vessels to be affected.",A.
D. 20 vessels or more,A.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The text indicates that Port of Savannah, GA, will be impacted by Zeta. Given the forecast track and potential for significant disruption, it's highly probable that the port will experience a substantial impact. Considering the average daily vessel count, a disruption leading to a significant number of vessels being affected is likely.",A.
