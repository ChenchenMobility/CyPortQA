Tornadoes are possible in parts of the region.,Isolated tornado risk cannot be ruled out inland; potential river/urban flooding impacts port operations
Tornadoes are possible along the west coast of Florida and over the Florida Panhandle.,Low-end risk of isolated brief tornadoes inland if remnants track nearby; possible minor river rises but no significant flooding forecast.
Tornadoes are possible near the west coast of Florida and the coastal Florida Panhandle.,Localized river or urban flooding from persistent rain bands
Tornadoes are possible over parts of the western Florida peninsula.,None
Tornadoes may be possible across portions of central and southern Florida.,Urban and small-stream flooding could disrupt terminal trucking and rail access
Tornadoes are a potential hazard in parts of central and south Florida.,Very low tornado risk associated with remnant frontal interaction
Swells generated by Fred could reach the coast of Delaware by early Saturday.,"Minor river/urban ponding possible if localized downpours occur, but no significant marine or port operational hazards anticipated"
Swells generated by Fred could reach the Florida Keys and southern Florida by early Saturday.,Up-river flooding on Delaware River could be aggravated if heavy upstream rainfall occurs; supply-chain delays likely from Gulf-coast impacts.
Swells generated by Fred are expected to spread across portions of the Bahamas and northern coast of Cuba during the next couple of days.,None anticipated
"Swells generated by Fred are expected to continue across the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Hispaniola tonight, where they could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.",None
