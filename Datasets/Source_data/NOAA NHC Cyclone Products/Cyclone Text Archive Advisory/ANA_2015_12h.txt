DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ana was
located near latitude 32.9 North, longitude 78.3 West. Ana is moving
toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn toward the north
and northeast with a gradual increase in forward speed is expected
over the next 48 hours.  On the forecast track, the center will be
very near the coasts of South and North Carolina by Sunday morning.

Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast as Ana moves over cooler waters close
to the coastline overnight.  A more rapid rate of weakening will
begin after the center crosses the coast.

Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.  NOAA buoy 41013, located about 35 miles (55 km)
south-southeast of Cape Fear North Carolina, recently reported
sustained winds of 42 mph (68 km/h) with a gust to 54 mph (86 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area, and are possible within the watch area, by this evening or
later tonight.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters.
The water could reach 1 to 2 ft above ground at times of high tide
in coastal areas from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina southward
through South Carolina.  For information specific to your area,
please see products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Ana is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 2 to
4 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches over eastern
portions of North Carolina and South Carolina through Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ana are affecting portions of the
southeastern U.S. coast.  These swells will likely cause life-
threatening surf and rip currents.  Please see statements issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
