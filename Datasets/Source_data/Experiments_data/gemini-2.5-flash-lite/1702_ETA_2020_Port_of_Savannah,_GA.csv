"The provided information includes the ""Tropical-Storm-Force Wind Speed Probabilities"" graphic and the ""WIND SPEED PROBABILITIES FOR SELECTED LOCATIONS"" table.

Let's examine the probability of tropical-storm-force winds (>= 39 mph) for Savannah, GA.
In the table, Savannah, GA shows:
- Probability of >= 34 kt (39 mph) from 12Z WED to 00Z THU: X
- Probability of >= 34 kt (39 mph) from 00Z THU to 12Z THU: 4(4)

The graphic also shows a low probability of tropical-storm-force winds impacting Savannah, GA. The highest probability is between 10-20% for a very limited time frame.

Given that the average daily number of vessels at the Port of Savannah is 15.42379069, and the probability of tropical-storm-force winds is very low and short-lived, it is unlikely that there will be a significant impact on the number of commercial vessels. The storm's primary impact seems to be further south in Florida.

Therefore, the most appropriate choice is that there will be minimal to no impact.
