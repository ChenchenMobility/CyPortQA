DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of the eye of Hurricane
Florence was located by an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft and
NOAA Doppler radar near latitude 34.2 North, longitude 77.4 West.
Florence is moving toward the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A
turn toward the west at a slow forward speed is expected today,
followed by a slow west-southwestward motion tonight and Saturday.
On the forecast track, the center of Florence is expected to move
inland across extreme southeastern North Carolina and extreme
eastern South Carolina today and Saturday.  Florence will then move
generally northward across the western Carolinas and the central
Appalachian Mountains early next week.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast later today and tonight.
Significant weakening is expected over the weekend and into early
next week while Florence moves farther inland.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).  A NOAA observing site at Cape Lookout, North
Carolina, recently reported a sustained wind of 72 mph (116 km/h)
and a gust of 90 mph (145 km/h).

The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter data is
958 mb (28.29 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water has the
potential to reach the following heights above ground...

Cape Fear NC to Cape Lookout NC...7-11 ft, with locally higher
amounts in the Neuse, Pamlico, Pungo, and Bay Rivers
Cape Lookout NC to Ocracoke Inlet NC...6-9 ft
South Santee River SC to Cape Fear NC...4-6 ft
Ocracoke Inlet NC to Salvo NC...4-6 ft
Salvo NC to Duck NC...2-4 ft
Edisto Beach SC to South Santee River SC...2-4 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

RAINFALL: Florence is expected to produce heavy and excessive
rainfall in the following areas...

Southeastern coastal North Carolina into far northeastern South
Carolina...an additional 20 to 25 inches, with isolated storm totals
of 30 to 40 inches. This rainfall will produce catastrophic flash
flooding and prolonged significant river flooding.

Remainder of South Carolina and North Carolina into southwest
Virginia...5 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches. This rainfall will
produce life-threatening flash flooding.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible in eastern North Carolina
today.

SURF:  Swells generated by Florence are affecting Bermuda, portions
of the U.S. East Coast, and the northwestern and central Bahamas.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
