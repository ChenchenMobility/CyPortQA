"As of August 30th, given that Hurricane Idalia is expected to make landfall in the Big Bend area of Florida on Wednesday morning, and considering that tropical storm conditions are already occurring along the west coast of Florida, it is suggested for general vessel activity at Manatee County Port, FL to exercise caution and be prepared for potential disruptions due to the approaching hurricane.",No vessels may enter or transit within the ports without the permission of the Captain of the Port; all vessel movements are prohibited.
"The National Weather Service has issued a storm surge warning for Manatee County Port, FL, indicating that there is a danger of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the coastline within the next 36 hours. Vessels should monitor the progress of Hurricane Idalia and follow any instructions given by local authorities to protect lives and property. It's important for vessel operators to stay informed about the situation and take necessary precautions, including preparing to evacuate if required.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum; vessels bound for SC, GA or FL that cannot safely offload and depart within 8 hours of threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"Given the ongoing storm surge watch and hurricane watch issued by the National Weather Service for the Gulf coast of Florida from Englewood to Indian Pass, including Tampa Bay, it is suggested that general vessel activity at Manatee County Port, FL be monitored closely and prepared for possible disruptions or restrictions. Vessels should stay informed about any updates on weather conditions and operational guidance issued by the port authority or relevant maritime agencies.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan.
"Considering the imminent landfall of Hurricane Idalia in Florida, it is suggested that ocean-going and commercial vessels at Manatee County Port should take necessary precautions, such as seeking safe shelter, reducing sailing to slow maneuvers, and maintaining communication with local authorities. The port may also be temporarily closed or restricted for safety reasons.",No vessels may enter or transit within the ports without the permission of the Captain of the Port; all vessel movements are prohibited.
"Given the forecast path of Hurricane Idalia and the possibility of storm surge and winds in the area, it is recommended that ocean-going and commercial vessels in the vicinity of Manatee County Port, FL should take necessary precautions or seek shelter to ensure the safety of the vessel and its crew.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum; vessels bound for SC, GA or FL that cannot safely offload and depart within 8 hours of threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"The National Weather Service has issued a Storm Surge Watch for the Gulf coast of Florida from Chokoloskee to Indian Pass, including Tampa Bay, and a Hurricane Watch for the Gulf coast of Florida from Englewood to Indian Pass, including Tampa Bay. It is recommended that ocean-going and commercial vessel activity at Manatee County Port, FL should be monitored closely as the storm approaches.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan.
"Given the current weather conditions and forecast, it is recommended that port and facility operations at Manatee County Port, FL should closely monitor weather updates, maintain communication with local authorities and emergency services, and prepare for potential impacts such as flooding, wind damage, and disruptions to transportation networks due to storm surges or debris from the surrounding area. It is also essential to ensure the safety of personnel and secure any loose cargo or equipment to minimize risks.",All waterfront operations are suspended; facility preparations should be completed.
"As of 4:00 AM EDT, Hurricane Idalia has a forecast track that will bring it close to the coast of Florida within the next few days, and is expected to strengthen into a major hurricane before making landfall. Port operations at Manatee County Port should be prepared for potential impacts from this storm, including storm surge, strong winds, and heavy rainfall. Facility operators should monitor the forecast track and follow any guidance or instructions provided by local authorities and port management.","Ports and facilities should minimize vessel inventory, emphasize that no safe havens exist, and secure the area for sustained winds of 35–43 mph expected within 24 hours."
"Based on the current weather conditions and context, it is recommended that port and facility operations at Manatee County Port, FL be closely monitored for any potential impacts related to Tropical Storm Idalia. As the storm is forecasted to bring heavy rainfall and potentially hurricane conditions to portions of the west coast of Florida, it is important to keep an eye on weather updates and take necessary precautions to ensure the safety of personnel and infrastructure at the port. This may include securing vessels, monitoring incoming and outgoing shipments, and staying updated on any advisories or warnings issued by local authorities or the National Weather Service.",Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and transfer operations may continue while Condition WHISKEY is in effect.
"Given that Hurricane Idalia is expected to make landfall on Wednesday near Tampa Bay, and there is a risk of storm surge flooding along the Gulf Coast, it is likely that general vessel activity at Manatee County Port, FL will be impacted in the next 12 hours. This may include port closures, restricted access to the port, or delays in vessel operations due to the potential for dangerous weather conditions and hazardous sea states. It is important for vessels operating near the affected area to closely monitor local weather forecasts and port updates for any necessary safety precautions or adjustments to their travel plans.",No vessels may enter or transit within the ports without the permission of the Captain of the Port; all vessel movements are prohibited.
"At Manatee County Port, FL, the most likely future operational guidance for general vessel activity would be to stay informed about the developing storm and potential impacts on port operations, as well as any specific advisories or warnings issued by local authorities or the National Weather Service.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum; vessels bound for SC, GA or FL that cannot safely offload and depart within 8 hours of threatening winds should seek an alternate port."
"Based on the current weather conditions and context, it is recommended to exercise caution when operating vessels at Manatee County Port, FL at the time in_24h. There may be an increased risk of storm surge, strong winds, and rough seas due to the approaching tropical storm.
