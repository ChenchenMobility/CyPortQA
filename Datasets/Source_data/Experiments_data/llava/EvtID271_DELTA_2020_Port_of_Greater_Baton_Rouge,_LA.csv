"The image you provided is a bulletin from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) detailing the latest information about Hurricane Delta. It indicates that Hurricane Delta is moving towards the northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h) and is expected to make landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula later today. The storm is forecast to weaken as it moves over the Yucatan peninsula, but could re-strengthen as it approaches the northern Gulf coast on Friday. The wind speed is currently 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher gusts, and the estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.76 inches).

The bulletin also mentions that a life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels in areas of onshore winds by as much as 6 to 9 ft above normal tide levels along the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, and that tropical storm conditions are already occurring in some areas. Rainfall is expected to be heavy, with totals of up to 12 inches in portions of the central Gulf Coast north into the Lower Mississippi Valley, which could lead to flash flooding and minor river flooding.

The bulletin also advises that swells generated by Delta will affect land areas around the northwestern Caribbean Sea for the next day or so, and that these swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. The NHC provides updates on Hurricane Delta's progress in its forecast discussions, which can be found under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41.KNHC, and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml.",3.0
