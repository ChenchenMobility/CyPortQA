"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory highlights significant impacts from Hurricane Ida, including storm surge, strong winds, and heavy rainfall along the Gulf Coast. While the advisory doesn's directly address Galveston, TX, the projected severity of the storm necessitates at least 20 commercial vessels to be impacted by disruptions such as port closures, rerouting, or delays.",A.
D. 20 vessels or more,A.
D. 20 vessels or more,A.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory indicates potential rainfall impacting the central U.S. Gulf Coast (including Galveston, TX) starting early Sunday. Given the potential for the system to strengthen into a hurricane and the potential for significant rainfall and possibly storm surge, Galveston would likely experience disruptions to port operations. It's reasonable to assume a significant number of vessels would seek shelter or experience delays, leading to a total impacted number above 20.",A.
