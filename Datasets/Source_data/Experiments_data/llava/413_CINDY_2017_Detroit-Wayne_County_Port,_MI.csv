Explanation: The gale force probability (34kt) refers to the likelihood of wind speeds reaching 34 knots (about 40 mph or 65 km/h) at a certain height (100 meters in this case). In this scenario, it is expected that the wind speed will reach 34 knots within the next 12 hours with a probability of 50% and within 24 hours with a probability of 20%. After that, the likelihood decreases to 5% at 48 hours and becomes zero thereafter.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '0%'}"
