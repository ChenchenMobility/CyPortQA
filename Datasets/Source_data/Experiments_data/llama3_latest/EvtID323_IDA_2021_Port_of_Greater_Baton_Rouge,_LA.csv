"The answer is not straightforward because there are multiple forecasts and probabilities provided in the text. However, I can help you find the closest estimate.

According to the forecast, the 34-kt wind probability at Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA is:

* 13% at CP SAN ANTONIO at 0345 UTC
* 1% at GFMX 280N 930W at 0000 UTC

Since these probabilities are relatively low and there are no other significant increases in the 34-kt wind probability within the next 5 days, I would estimate that the maximum probability of 34-kt winds remains for a short duration around the times mentioned above.

Assuming an average duration of 1 hour for each of these events, we can estimate that the maximum 34-kt wind probability lasts for approximately 2 hours.",60

"I apologize for not being able to understand the format of your message earlier. It seems like you've provided weather forecast data in a structured format.

To answer your question, I'll need to extract relevant information from the text. After examining the data, I found that Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA has multiple forecasts with wind probabilities ranging from 1-64 knots (kt). Since you're asking about the 34-kt wind probability, I'll focus on those specific forecasts.

The forecast data appears to be in a format where each row represents a different forecast location and time. To find the answer, I would need to identify which forecast location is closest to Port of Greater Baton Rouge, LA. However, since you didn't specify this information, I'll assume that it's not provided in the given data.
