Swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Minor coastal rip-current risk on Gulf beaches
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Enhanced rip-current risk along Gulf beaches; minor operational delays from squalls.
Swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Increased rip-current risk in the Gulf may occur but no major operational hazards expected
Swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Occasional lightning in squalls; choppy bay/near-shore seas could hamper small-craft movements
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Brief reductions in visibility and increased lightning risk in squalls; potential vessel schedule disruptions due to precautionary routing around the peninsula.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Rough bay/near-shore seas and higher than normal tides could briefly affect small-craft operations
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,"Minimal – routine marine operations may see higher Atlantic swells, but Gulf waters near the port remain largely undisturbed."
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,Choppy bays/seas and dangerous rip currents in the eastern Gulf could briefly disrupt vessel movements.
Swells and rip currents.,Choppy seas in the approaches to Tampa Bay and occasional squalls could disrupt vessel scheduling even without a direct strike.
Swells and rip currents.,Dangerous rip currents and rough seas in approaches; intermittent squalls reducing visibility and hampering cargo handling
