**Reasoning:**
- The storm is expected to be near or at hurricane strength by Sunday.
- The storm's track and wind probability forecasts indicate significant impact on the Texas coast, particularly around Galveston and Corpus Christi, starting from late Saturday through Monday.
- The port of Galveston is within the high probability zone for tropical-storm-force winds, with a cumulative probability reaching 25% by Sunday and 29% by Monday.
- Given the expected intensity and the direct path of the storm, the port is likely to experience significant disruptions starting late Saturday, with recovery beginning after the storm passes, likely by Tuesday.",None
