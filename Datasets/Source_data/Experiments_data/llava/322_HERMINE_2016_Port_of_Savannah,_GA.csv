"The forecast is for the probability to peak again within the next 5 days after it has already peaked once. Therefore, we need to find the number of hours until the first occurrence of this second peak in wind probability.

We can look at the column labeled ""FT MYERS FL"" and count how many rows are left from the current row (which is Port of Savannah, GA) until the wind probability reaches 34 kt again within the next 5 days.

In the ""FT MYERS FL"" column, there are a total of 67 rows. The current row is the 62nd row from the bottom. So we need to count up 62 rows from the bottom.

To do this, we can subtract the current row number (62) from the total number of rows (67), which gives us:

67 - 62 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 hours remaining until the wind probability peaks again at Port of Savannah, GA within the next 5 days.",30

"48-HOUR OUTLOOK AT 236 PM EDT
------------------------------
At 236 pm EDT, the center of Tropical Depression Nine was located near latitude 23.0 North, longitude 85.2 West. The depression is moving toward the west-northwest at 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn toward the north-northeast is expected on Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of the depression will continue to move slowly away from western Cuba and into the eastern Gulf of Mexico over the next 48 hours. Some strengthening is expected during this time, and the depression is expected to become a tropical storm later today or early Wednesday.
