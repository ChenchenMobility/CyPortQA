"The image shows an official weather advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for Tropical Storm Arthur on May 17, 2020. It provides information about the current status of the storm, including its location, movement, intensity, and expected path. It also includes a warning for tropical storm conditions along the North Carolina coast on Monday. The advisory warns that swells generated by Tropical Storm Arthur could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts, and advises to consult products from your local weather office.",5/19/2020
"The forecast does not provide specific details about the expected start of impact on freight at Baltimore, MD. However, it suggests that Arthur may become a tropical storm within 48 hours and may bring storm conditions to portions of the North Carolina coast. It is likely that the impact on freight at Baltimore, MD would depend on the track and intensity of Tropical Storm Arthur as it moves northward along the eastern seaboard. If the storm makes landfall along the coast of North Carolina or makes a closer approach to the coast, it could affect freight operations in the region.",5/19/2020
"I'm sorry, but as a language model AI, I don't have access to real-time weather data or forecasts.

"The image shows a weather map with Tropical Storm Arthur's projected path.

However, the precise date and time for the predicted peak impact on freight at Baltimore, MD, are not explicitly shown in the image.

For accurate weather forecasts and potential impacts on freight, it's important to monitor official sources such as the National Weather Service or local meteorological services. They provide detailed information about weather conditions, storm tracks, and any necessary precautions or advisories.",5/19/2020
"The image you provided appears to be a forecast or advisory related to Tropical Storm Arthur from the National Weather Service (NWS). It does not explicitly predict the ""peak impact on freight at Baltimore, MD."" However, I can provide some information that may help answer your question.

Tropical storms and hurricanes often have significant impacts on transportation networks, including ports and freight operations. When such a storm is approaching, it typically brings strong winds, heavy rainfall, and sometimes storm surges, all of which can disrupt operations at ports like Baltimore. The peak impact could include delays in the arrival or departure of ships, temporary closure of the port, damage to infrastructure or cargo handling equipment, or even long-term effects if the storm causes significant damage.

To predict the exact date for the peak impact on freight at Baltimore, we would need more detailed and specific information about the forecast track, intensity, and timing of Tropical Storm Arthur. The NWS advisory you provided does not include a timeline for the peak impact; it only states that ""Tropical storm conditions are expected within the Tropical Storm Warning area on Monday.""

The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations and earlier aircraft reconnaissance data is 1008 mb (29.77 inches). Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area on Monday, and swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of the east coast of central and northern Florida, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.
