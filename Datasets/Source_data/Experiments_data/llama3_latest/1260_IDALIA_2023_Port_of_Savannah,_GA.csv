"Based on the forecasted rainfall and winds, I would assign the Port of Savannah, GA's condition under tropical cyclone at the time in_48h as:

D. YANKEE",D.
"Based on the information provided, I would assign the Port of Savannah, GA's condition under tropical cyclone at the time in 48h as:

C. X-RAY

This is because the storm is expected to be a tropical storm by Sunday, and Savannah, GA is not within the warning or watch areas mentioned in the advisory. However, it is still possible that the port could experience some effects from the storm, such as heavy rainfall or strong winds, which would warrant an X-RAY condition.",B.
"Based on the advisory, I would choose:

D. YANKEE

Explanation: The Port of Savannah, GA is located outside the Tropical Storm Warning area and within a reasonable distance from the expected center of the storm's circulation. Therefore, it is likely to experience tropical storm-force winds (34-39 mph) in 60 hours, which warrants a YANKEE condition.",C.
"Based on the information provided, I would assign the Port of Savannah, GA's condition under tropical cyclone as:

B. WHISKEY

This is because Tropical Depression Ten is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3-6 inches across portions of the eastern Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba, which does not directly impact Savannah, GA. However, heavy rainfall is also likely to impact portions of the Gulf Coast and Southeast by mid-to late next week, which could potentially affect Savannah's weather conditions.",D.
"Given Hurricane Idalia's forecasted track and potential impacts, vessels are advised to prepare for heavy winds, rough seas, and possible grounding hazards by securing all loose items on deck, setting anchors if possible, and seeking shelter in a safe harbor or anchorage area as soon as possible. Additionally, vessel operators should monitor updates from local authorities and adjust their plans accordingly to minimize risks and ensure the safety of crew and vessels.","Mariners are reminded there are no safe havens in port; ports are safest when the inventory of vessels is at a minimum, and all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures."
"No specific guidance is provided in this advisory for the Port of Savannah, GA. However, it suggests that ""Interests along the southeastern U.S. coast should monitor the progress of this system."" This implies that vessels and mariners at the Port of Savannah should be aware of the potential impact of Hurricane Idalia on their operations and take necessary precautions to ensure safety.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must obtain Captain of the Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan.
"Given the forecasted rainfall and potential flooding in the area, no general vessel activity restrictions are currently suggested for the Port of Savannah, GA. However, vessels may need to exercise caution when navigating in areas prone to flooding or strong winds.","Vessels that wish to remain in port must obtain permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels bound for South Carolina, Georgia or Florida that cannot safely off-load and depart within 24 hours of threatening winds should divert to an alternate port."
"Based on the current weather conditions and forecast, it is suggested that ocean-going and commercial vessels avoid entering or transiting through the Port of Savannah, GA until further notice, as Hurricane Idalia is expected to bring strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas to the area, posing a significant risk to vessel safety. Additionally, vessels already in port should prepare for possible storm surge flooding and take necessary precautions to secure their vessels and cargo.","Mariners are reminded there are no safe havens in port; ports are safest when the inventory of vessels is at a minimum, and all vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures."
