"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

*   **Hurricane Intensity & Location:** The advisory indicates that Hurricane Ida is expected to bring ""total rainfall accumulations of 8 to 16 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches"" to the Plaquemines Port District area. It also mentions the possibility of ""considerable flash, urban, small stream, and riverine flooding impacts.""
*   **Port Operations & Safety:** Commercial ports like Plaquemines Port District prioritize safety. Severe weather events like hurricanes force closures and evacuations of vessels to avoid damage and ensure the safety of crews.
*   **Average Vessel Count:** With an average of nearly 59 vessels daily, a hurricane event will almost certainly lead to a significant disruption and likely complete closure of the port. While precise numbers are impossible to predict, a significant disruption impacting a large number of vessels is more probable than minimal impact.



Therefore, given the forecast intensity and impacts, and considering port safety protocols, 20 vessels or more being impacted is the most logical choice.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The forecast for Ida indicates extremely heavy rainfall and potential hurricane conditions for the Plaquemines Port District. Given the average daily vessel count of roughly 58, significant disruption and potential delays are highly likely. A complete shutdown or major rerouting of vessels would be expected under such conditions. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is that 20 or more vessels would be impacted.",D.
