"Here's how we can solve this:

The question asks when the probability of 34-kt winds at Manatee County Port, FL first rises above zero.

Looking at the text, we need to find the first numerical value associated with Manatee County. Here it is:

""VENICE FL      34  X  13(13)  12(25)   7(32)   X(32)   X(32)   X(32)""

This indicates 13 kt winds within 13 hours. I'm assuming that's not what is being asked. However, without knowing more about the next best guess is:

""GRAND BAHAMA   34 18  29(47)   1(48)   X(48)
