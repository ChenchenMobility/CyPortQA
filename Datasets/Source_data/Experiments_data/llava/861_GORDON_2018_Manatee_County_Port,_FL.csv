2. The Mexican coastline, as there is a chance of tropical cyclone landfall in that region, which could impact ports in Mexico or along its coast.
3. The Caribbean Coastal Area (CCCA), which includes parts of Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the west coast of Cuba, as there is a possibility of additional development and spread into these areas.

Explanation:

* At 12 hours, the gale force probability is 10, which means there is a 10% chance of gale-force winds (34kt or 45 mph) in that time frame.
* At 24 hours, the gale force probability is 5, indicating a 5% chance of gale-force winds in this time frame.
* At 48 hours, the gale force probability is 3, meaning there is a 3% chance of gale-force winds at that point in time.
* At 72 hours, the gale force probability is 1, indicating only a 1% chance of gale-force winds by this time.
* At 96 hours (4 days), the gale force probability is 0, which means there is no chance of gale-force winds at that point in time based on the information provided in the bulletin.

Note: These probabilities are based on the information available at the time the bulletin was issued and may change as more data becomes available.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '1%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '0%'}"
