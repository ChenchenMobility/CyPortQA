"Based on the provided information, the port of Mobile, Alabama, is expected to be affected by the remnants of Fred starting from 12Z Monday (around 7 AM CDT Monday) to 12Z Tuesday (around 7 AM CDT Tuesday). Given that tropical-storm-force winds are expected to be the primary impact, and considering typical recovery times for ports after tropical storm conditions, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations could recover by the following day. Therefore, the number of days expected for the port's freight to recover is:

**2**",2.0
"Based on the provided information, the port most likely to be significantly impacted is Apalachicola, Florida. The wind probability table indicates that tropical-storm-force winds (34 kt or higher) have a cumulative probability of 26% starting from 48 hours (00Z MON) and peaking at 72 hours (00Z TUE). Additionally, the track forecast cone shows the storm moving inland near this location around Monday night. Given the potential for significant wind and rain impacts, the port's freight operations could be disrupted for a few days.

Considering the typical recovery time for ports after a tropical storm, which includes reassessment of damage, clearing of any debris, and restoring full operations, an estimate of 3 days for the port's freight to recover seems reasonable.",2.0
