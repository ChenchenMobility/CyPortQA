Since the question specifically asks for a choice (A, B, C, or D) and the data is incomplete, we cannot provide an accurate answer. However, if we were to infer based on typical meteorological data, we would need to select the option that indicates the uncertainty or lack of data. In this case, the most appropriate choice would be:
