DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Marco was
located near latitude 21.9 North, longitude 85.7 West.  Marco is
moving toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  Marco is 
expected to continue moving toward the north-northwest across the 
central Gulf of Mexico on Sunday and is forecast to reach the 
northern Gulf coast on Monday.  After moving inland, Marco is 
expected to slow down and turn toward the northwest and 
west-northwest Monday night and Tuesday, moving across southern 
Louisiana into east Texas.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next day or two, and 
Marco is expected to become a hurricane tonight or on Sunday.  
Marco is likely to still be at or near hurricane strength when it 
reaches the northern Gulf coast on Monday.   Weakening is forecast 
to occur while the center moves farther inland Monday night and 
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Grand Isle LA to the AL/FL Border including Lake Borgne and Mobile 
Bay...3-5 ft 
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...2-4 ft
Sabine Pass to Grand Isle LA...2-4 ft 

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of 
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and 
destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative 
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over 
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see 
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch 
area by midday Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by 
early Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the 
tropical storm watch area on Monday.

Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue within the 
warning area in Cuba through this evening.
 
RAINFALL:  Marco is expected to produce the following rainfall 
accumulations through Monday: 

Far western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated maximum 
amounts of 6 inches possible

Eastern portions of the Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucatan: 
1 to 3 inches.

Central U.S. Gulf Coast: 1 to 3 inches, isolated maximum amounts of 
5 inches.

This rainfall may result in areas of flash and urban flooding along 
the Central U.S. Gulf Coast.
