Higos,High surf and dangerous rip currents along the Southern California coast beginning this weekend
"Lidia's impact may also include hazardous surf conditions along the California coast, particularly in areas such as La Jolla Shores and Mission Beach, potentially causing life-threatening rip currents.",Increased surf and dangerous rip currents along Southern California beaches Sunday–Monday.
"The possible future storm Lidia may pose a risk of disrupted port operations and increased marine traffic congestion at San Diego Unified Port, CA, due to rough seas and potentially hazardous surf conditions.","Large swells may reach southern California beaches early next week, producing strong rip currents that could affect small-craft operations."
Harold,Long-period south-southwest swells could produce elevated surf and rip-current risk along San Diego beaches this weekend and early next week.
Flooded dockside areas and potential damage to cargo and equipment due to rough seas generated by the approaching cyclone's swells.,Long-period swells creating higher surf and dangerous rip currents along the Southern California coast beginning late week-end.
