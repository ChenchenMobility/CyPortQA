"The provided images and text discuss Tropical Storm Elsa. The question asks about the impact on commercial vessels at Baltimore, MD.

The ""Future Wind Probability Table"" shows probabilities of sustained winds of at least 34 knots (39 mph) for various locations. For Baltimore, MD, the cumulative probability of experiencing 34 kt winds over the entire 5-day forecast period is listed as X (less than 1%). This indicates a very low probability of any tropical storm-force winds reaching Baltimore.

The ""Tropical Storm Elsa Track Forecast Cone"" graphic shows the projected path of the storm. Baltimore, MD is located well inland and significantly north of the forecast cone, suggesting it is unlikely to experience direct impacts from the storm.

The ""Tropical Storm-Force Wind Speed Probabilities"" graphic also shows a very low probability of tropical-storm-force winds reaching Baltimore.

Given the extremely low probability of tropical-storm-force winds in Baltimore, it is highly improbable that commercial vessel operations would be significantly impacted. Therefore, the number of impacted vessels would be negligible.

The question asks for the ""total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels"". With a less than 1% chance of tropical storm force winds, the most appropriate answer is that no vessels would be impacted.

Therefore, the answer is A.
