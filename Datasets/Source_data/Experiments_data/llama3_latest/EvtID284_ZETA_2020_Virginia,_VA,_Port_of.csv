If you're looking for an estimate on when the impact on freight might end, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific date without more information. However, based on the forecast, it seems that the impact could potentially last until late Wednesday or early Thursday.

"A complex request!

The forecast information you're looking for is scattered throughout the advisory text. After analyzing the data, I found that there are no specific predictions regarding the end of impact on freight at the Virginia, VA, Port of.

However, I can provide some general insights based on the storm's projected path and intensity:

* Tropical Storm Zeta is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by late Monday while approaching the Yucatan Peninsula.
* The storm's track will bring it near or over the northern Yucatan Peninsula or the Yucatan Channel later this week, which may impact maritime traffic and freight operations.

To provide an answer to your question, I'll make an educated guess based on the storm's projected path. Assuming Zeta maintains its current intensity and trajectory, I would estimate that the end of impact on freight at Virginia, VA, Port of would likely be around **27-30 November 2020** (DD-MM-YYYY).

Please note that this is a rough estimate and may not reflect actual events or changes in the storm's track. For more accurate information, I recommend monitoring official weather forecasts and advisories from trusted sources like the National Hurricane Center (NHC) or local authorities.",None
