"Based on the information provided in the bulletin, it is not possible to provide an exact date for when the impact from Tropical Storm Grace will start affecting freight at St. Croix, VI. However, the storm is expected to make landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico early Thursday, and move into the southwest Gulf of Mexico early Friday. The swells generated by the storm are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the southern coast of Cuba through today.
