The answer is B. 0-24 Hours.,A.
"The correct answer is D. 48 hours or more.

According to the forecast data, the probability of 34-kt winds at Wilmington, NC remains zero until after 48 hours, which means that there are no high probabilities (above zero) in the first 24 hours and also not in the next 24 hours. Therefore, the answer is D. 48 hours or more.",A.
