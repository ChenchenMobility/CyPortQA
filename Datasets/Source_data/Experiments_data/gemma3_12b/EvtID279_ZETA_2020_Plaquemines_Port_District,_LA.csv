"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Explanation:**

The provided information does not provide any indication regarding the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Plaquemines Port District, LA over the entire event. Therefore, using the information provided, there is no way to arrive at the correct answer. However, based on a general analysis of the information provided, hurricanes and tropical storms often lead to significant disruptions of port operations. Therefore, a higher-end estimate of impacted vessels, such as ""20 vessels or more,"" would be reasonable.",D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory explicitly states that a Hurricane Warning is in effect for ""Morgan City Louisiana to the Mississippi/Alabama border"" which includes the Plaquemines Port District. Given a daily average of nearly 58 vessels, a hurricane warning would likely cause significant disruption and a substantial reduction in vessel traffic. It's unlikely to be ""none"" or a small number (1-10) given the scale of the port and the severity of the warning. A substantial decrease is expected, but a complete shutdown isn't guaranteed. 20 or more vessels impacted suggests a significant, but not total, disruption—consistent with a hurricane warning situation that might still see some essential traffic.",D.
