Rip currents are a potential hazard.,Localized flash-flood risk in low-lying and urban areas due to heavy rain bands
,"A low-end risk of brief, weak inland tornadoes cannot be ruled out if remnant Fred tracks close to the Mid-Atlantic, but the probability at the port is very low."
Swells and potential tornadoes could impact port operations.,Minor river or urban flooding possible if local heavy downpours occur mid-week
Tornadoes are a possible hazard.,"Minor river or urban flooding possible if heavy showers align with high tide, otherwise operational impacts limited"
Potential hazards include coastal erosion and navigational hazards due to shifting channels and debris.,None anticipated that would affect port operations during the forecast period.
Isolated tornadoes pose a risk.,Isolated tornado risk remains confined to Florida; not applicable to New Jersey
"Potential hazards include rip currents, coastal erosion, and hazardous marine conditions.",Minor river/urban flooding possible if locally heavy rain bands reach Delaware Valley; otherwise no significant hazards for port operations
"Potential hazards include rip currents, coastal erosion, and impacts to navigation due to altered channel depths.",Minor river rises or localized ponding possible if remnants pass nearby
Coastal erosion and potential disruption of navigation due to debris are possible.,None

"The provided text doesn't contain information about the number of commercial vessels impacted at South Jersey Port Corp. It focuses on Tropical Storm Fred's path, warnings, and potential hazards. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the number of impacted vessels based on this text.

Since I can't answer based on the provided information, I will choose the safest option. **A. None**",A.
A. None,A.
,A.
B,A.
,A.
"**D. 20 vessels or more**

Here's the reasoning:

*   **Event Duration:** The forecast indicates impacts (rainfall, wind) extending from Saturday through Monday, a total of 3 days.
*   **Severity:** The forecast highlights potential for significant rainfall, wind, and even tornado risk. These conditions would likely disrupt vessel operations and port activity.
*   **Port Disruption:** Given the forecast severity, a significant number of vessels would be affected, leading to port closures or severely reduced operations.
*   **Daily Average:** While the average is 12.28 vessels daily, the event likely significantly exceeds that level.",A.

The text discusses a tropical depression (Fred) and its potential impacts on various locations, including Haiti, Cuba, and Florida, but it doesn't mention the South Jersey Port Corp or provide any specific numbers related to vessel impacts.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A. None**.",A.
