DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK

At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 53.9 West. Jose is moving toward
the west near 18 mph (30 km/h). A slower west-northwestward motion
is expected during the next couple of days. On the forecast
track, Jose is expected to be near the northern Leeward Islands on
Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Jose is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some slight strengthening is possible during
the next day or so.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch
area on Saturday, and tropical storm conditions are expected
within the tropical storm warning areas by Saturday morning.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
areas by Saturday morning.

RAINFALL: Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
2 to 6 inches in the Leeward Islands from Dominica to Anguilla.
Isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible in the northern
Leeward Islands from Antigua and Barbuda to Anguilla. This rainfall
will maintain any ongoing flooding and may cause additional
life-threatening flooding.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are expected to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands by late Friday.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
