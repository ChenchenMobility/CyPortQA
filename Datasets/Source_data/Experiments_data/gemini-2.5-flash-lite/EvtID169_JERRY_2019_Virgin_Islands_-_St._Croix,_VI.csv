"None of the provided options are appropriate. The graphic displays wind probability forecasts for Tropical Storm Jerry, with its center located east of Bermuda. The options provided are ports located on the coast of the United States and the Virgin Islands, which are not in the vicinity of the storm's projected path according to this graphic. Therefore, without additional information or a different graphic, it is impossible to determine which of the listed ports might experience gale-force winds first.",C.
