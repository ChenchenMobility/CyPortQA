"To determine the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days, we need to look at the probabilities listed for the 50-kt wind arrival for each of the next five days.

From the data provided:
- Day 1: X (0-06: 0 (X)
- Day 01-06: 0 (X)
- Day 02-06: 9
- Day 03-06: 2
- Day 04-06: 0 (X)

Summing these probabilities:
9 + 2 = 11

So the cumulative probability is 11.",11%
11,10%
"To determine the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days, we need to locate the relevant data in the provided forecast.

The forecast lists probabilities for different wind speeds at various locations. For Plaquemines Port District, we need to find the probabilities for 50-kt winds at ""NEW ORLEANS LA"" which is the closest listed location to Plaquemines Port District.

From the forecast:
- Day 1: X (0%)
- Day 2: X (0%)
- Day 3: 8 (8%)
- Day 4: X (0%)
- Day 5: 1 (1%)

To find the cumulative probability, we sum these probabilities:
0% + 0% + 8% + 0% + 1% = 9%

So, the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Plaquemines Port District, LA within the next 5 days is 9.",8%
