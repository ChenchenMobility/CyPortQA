"According to the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, I estimate the cyclone will make landfall in 48 hours.",≈12
"Please provide me with the cyclone's current position and the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, and I'll be happy to calculate the time to landfall!

   [Forecast Point 1] - 24.8°N 83.9°W (48 hours)
   [Forecast Point 2] - 26.3°N 82.4°W (72 hours)
