"* Port operations should prepare for potential tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall, with probabilities of sustained winds of 39+ mph reaching 53% to 73% by Wednesday evening.
* Due to the possibility of storm surge and the hurricane conditions expected along the coast, vessel activity may need to be suspended or restricted to ensure safety and preparedness.",Port Condition Zulu in effect: all vessel movements within the port are suspended.
"* **Port of Brunswick, GA should expect tropical storm force winds (39+ mph) to begin around 18Z Wednesday, with a 53% cumulative probability, and hurricane force winds (74+ mph) have a 23% chance to impact the area by Thursday afternoon.**
* **Given the potential for significant wind and surge, it is advisable for ocean-going and commercial vessels to cease operations and seek safe harbor well in advance of the expected arrival of tropical storm conditions.**",Port Condition Zulu in effect: all vessel movements within the port are suspended.
"Port of Brunswick, GA should anticipate tropical storm force winds (39+ mph) with a 53% probability of onset by 18Z Wednesday and a cumulative probability of 73% by 06Z Thursday.

"Based on the provided data, Port of Brunswick, GA is forecast to experience tropical-storm-force winds (>= 39 mph) with a probability of 30-40% within the next 12 hours (by 8 PM EDT on September 3, 2019). Given this significant probability of sustained tropical storm force winds, general vessel activity at the Port of Brunswick, GA should be suspended, and preparations for potential hurricane conditions should be prioritized.",Port Condition Zulu in effect: all vessel movements within the port are suspended.
"* Vessel operations at Port of Brunswick, GA are likely to be suspended or severely restricted due to the projected path of Hurricane Dorian, which shows a significant probability of tropical storm-force winds reaching the area within 24 hours.
* Given the high probability of 39 mph winds (30% chance as per the table for Savannah, GA at the 24-hour mark, and the track moving closer to the GA coast), port authorities will likely issue advisories to secure vessels and cease all cargo operations to ensure safety.",Port Condition Zulu in effect: all vessel movements within the port are suspended.
"* Ocean-going and commercial vessel activity at Port of Brunswick, GA should be suspended or significantly curtailed.

"* Port of Brunswick, GA has a 4% probability of experiencing tropical storm force winds (39 mph) within the next 24 hours.
* Given this low probability and the current track, operations at Port of Brunswick are likely to continue with normal procedures in the next 24 hours, though monitoring of the forecast is recommended.",Port Condition Zulu in effect: all vessel movements within the port are suspended.
"* Port operations at Brunswick, GA can expect tropical-storm-force wind probabilities of 30-40% by the time in_12h.
* This suggests that while port conditions will begin to deteriorate, operations may still be feasible for a limited time before potentially needing to cease.","Port facilities are closed, cargo operations are suspended, and storm-secure measures are in place."
"* Port of Brunswick, GA has a 5-10% chance of experiencing tropical storm force winds (39+ mph) within the next 24 hours.
