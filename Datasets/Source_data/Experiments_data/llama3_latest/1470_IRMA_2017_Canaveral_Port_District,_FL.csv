... (rest of the text)

Unfortunately, the forecasted probabilities are not provided in a clear and concise manner. The probabilities seem to be scattered throughout the text, making it difficult to extract the specific probability for Canaveral Port District, FL.

However, I can suggest some possible ways to estimate the cumulative probability:

1. Look for similar forecasts in other locations (e.g., Miami or Tampa) that might provide a comparable probability.
2. Search online archives of weather services like the National Hurricane Center (NHC) or the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) for historical data on wind probabilities at Canaveral Port District, FL.
3. Contact a local meteorological office or consult with a professional forecaster to obtain the desired information.

Please note that these suggestions are not guaranteed to provide an accurate answer, as the text does not explicitly provide the necessary information.

In summary, I must admit that I cannot provide a specific number for the cumulative probability of 50-kt wind arrival at Canaveral Port District, FL within the next 5 days due to the lack of clear and concise data in the provided text.",55%
