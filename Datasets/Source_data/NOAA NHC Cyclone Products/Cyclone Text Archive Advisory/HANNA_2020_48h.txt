HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Eight can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical Storm conditions are expected in the warning area
by Friday night or Saturday morning.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area by Friday night or Saturday morning.
 
RAINFALL:  The tropical depression is expected to produce 3 to 5
inches of rain with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches through
Monday along the Gulf Coast of the United States from Louisiana to
south Texas, and inland to the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo
Leon, and northern Tamaulipas.  This rain may result in
life-threatening flash flooding, rapid rises on small streams, and
isolated minor-to-moderate river flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the tropical cyclone are expected to
increase and affect much of the Texas and Louisiana coasts during
the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
