The storm is currently moving north-northeastward near 2 mph (4 km/h) and is expected to strengthen further during the next day or two. The maximum sustained winds are already at near 40 mph (65 km/h), with higher gusts, and the storm could be near hurricane strength by the time landfall occurs.

Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the warning area on Thursday afternoon. Hurricane conditions are possible over portions of the hurricane watch area beginning Thursday afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are also possible in the tropical storm watch area by early Friday.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide: Indian Pass to Ochlockonee River (2 to 4 feet), Ochlockonee River to Chassahowitzka (3 to 5 feet), and Chassahowitzka to Aripeka (2 to 4 feet). A ripple effect is expected in the area around Tampa Bay, with a height of 1 to 2 feet.

Storm total rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches are possible over portions of central and northern Florida through Friday, with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible. Coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas are expected to receive storm total rainfall of 4 to 7 inches, with local amounts of 10 inches possible through Saturday morning. These rains may cause flooding and flash flooding.
