Port Everglades is not explicitly listed, but Fort Lauderdale, which is near Port Everglades, is often used as a proxy. However, Fort Lauderdale is also not listed. The closest relevant location is probably Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL), which is near Port Everglades.

Since Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) is not listed, we need to use the closest available data, which is Fort Lauderdale. Assuming Fort Lauderdale data can be used as a proxy for Port Everglades:

Fort Lauderdale is not listed, so we need to use the closest available data, which is Miami, FL.

Miami, FL:
- Day 1: X
- Day 2: X
- Day 3: 1
- Day 4: 22
- Day 5: 23

The cumulative probability is the sum of the probabilities for each day:

"The provided data does not include information for ""Port Everglades, FL"" specifically. However, the closest relevant location in the data is ""Ft. Lauderdale, FL,"" which is near Port Everglades.

Based on the data for ""Ft. Lauderdale, FL"":

- 0-12 hours: X
- 12-24 hours: 12
- 24-48 hours: 12
- 48 hours or more: X

Since the highest probability for 34-kt winds is indicated by the highest number, and both the 12-24 hours and 24-48 hours intervals show ""12,"" we need to choose the earliest interval.

Therefore, the answer is:

- 24-48 hours: 2 (40)
- 48 hours or more: X

Based on the provided data for FLL, the highest 34-kt wind probability is in the 12-248 hours or more interval.

However, since the question asks for the 34-kt wind probability, and the data provided does not specify 34-kt winds for Port Everglades directly, we should use the 34-kt data for the closest available location, which is Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport (FLL).
