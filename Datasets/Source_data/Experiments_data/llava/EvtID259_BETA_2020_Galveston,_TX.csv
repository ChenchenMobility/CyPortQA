"The image shows a map of tropical storm Betty and there's no visible location of the current eye of the cyclone. However, if you're asking where the tropical storm is located in terms of its coordinates, it's important to note that the eye of a tropical cyclone can be difficult to track as it's typically a small area with low pressure and strong winds. In this image, there are concentric circles around the center of the storm, indicating wind speed and direction. The forecast cone provided by the National Hurricane Center shows the projected path of the storm, which currently does not include any specific coordinates for the eye of the cyclone.","27.6N, 94.8W"
