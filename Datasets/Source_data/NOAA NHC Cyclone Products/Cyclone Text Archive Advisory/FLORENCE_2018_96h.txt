DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Florence was located
near latitude 25.4 North, longitude 61.1 West. Florence is moving
toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). This general motion
with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple
of days. A turn toward the northwest is forecast to occur late
Wednesday night. On the forecast track, the center of Florence will
move over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and the
Bahamas Tuesday and Wednesday, and approach the coast of South
Carolina or North Carolina on Thursday.

Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum
sustained winds have increased near 140 mph (220 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Florence is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-
Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Further strengthening is anticipated,
and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major
hurricane through Thursday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure from NOAA Hurricane Hunter
aircraft data is 939 mb (27.73 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Florence are affecting Bermuda and
portions of the U.S. East Coast.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
