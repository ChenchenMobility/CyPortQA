DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ida was located 
near latitude 28.0 North, longitude 89.1 West. Ida is moving toward 
the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general motion should 
continue through tonight and early Monday, followed by a slower 
northward motion on Monday afternoon.  A northeastward turn is 
forecast by Monday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Ida 
will continue moving across the north-central Gulf of Mexico this 
morning, and make landfall along the coast of southeastern Louisiana 
within the hurricane warning area this afternoon or evening. Ida is 
then forecast to move well inland over portions of Louisiana and 
western Mississippi on Monday and Monday night.
 
Satellite and Doppler radar data indicate that maximum sustained 
winds have increased to near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Ida is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind 
Scale.  Some additional strengthening is forecast, and Ida is 
expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane when it makes 
landfall along the Louisiana coast this afternoon. Rapid weakening 
is expected after landfall.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 946 mb (27.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ida can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the 
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by 
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could 
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated 
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River...12-16 ft
Morgan City, LA to Port Fourchon, LA ...8-12 ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River to Bay St. Louis, MS including Lake
Borgne...8-12 ft
Burns Point, LA to Morgan City, LA...6-9 ft
Bay St. Louis, MS to Ocean Springs, MS...6-9 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...5-8 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL border...4-7 ft
Intracoastal City, LA to Burns Point, LA including Vermilion
Bay...4-6 ft
Lake Maurepas...4-6 ft
Pecan Island, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...2-4 ft
MS/AL border to AL/FL border including Mobile Bay...3-5 ft
Sabine Pass to Pecan Island, LA...1-3 ft
AL/FL border to Okaloosa/Walton County Line including Pensacola 
Bay...1-3 ft

Overtopping of local levees outside of the Hurricane and Storm
Damage Risk Reduction System is possible where local inundation
values may be higher than those shown above.

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the Hurricane Warning
area along the Louisiana coast beginning by later this morning with
tropical storm conditions expected to begin by early this morning.
These conditions will spread inland over portions of Louisiana and
Mississippi tonight and Monday.
 
RAINFALL:   Heavy rainfall from Ida will begin to impact the
southeast Louisiana coast this morning, spreading northeast into the
Lower Mississippi Valley later today into Monday.  Total rainfall
accumulations of 10 to 18 inches with isolated maximum amounts of
24 inches are possible across southeast Louisiana into far southern
Mississippi through Monday. This is likely to result in
life-threatening flash and urban flooding and significant riverine
flooding impacts.
 
Ida is forecast to turn to the northeast early Monday and track
across the Middle Tennessee Valley and Ohio Valley through
Wednesday, producing the following rainfall totals:
 
Coastal Alabama to the far western Florida panhandle: 5 to 10 inches
with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches, today through Tuesday
morning.
 
Central Mississippi: 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of
12 inches, tonight through Monday night.
 
Middle Tennessee Valley to the Ohio Valley: 3 to 6 inches with
isolated higher amounts, Tuesday into Wednesday.
 
These rainfall totals will result in considerable flash and riverine
flooding.
 
TORNADOES:  Tornadoes will be possible today into Monday from
southeast Louisiana across southeast  Mississippi and southwest
Alabama to the western Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells are beginning to reach the northern Gulf coast and
will continue to affect that area through Monday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
