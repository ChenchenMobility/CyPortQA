DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Delta was located
by satellite images and surface observation inland over northeastern 
Mexico near latitude 21.1 North, longitude 87.4 West. Delta is 
moving toward the northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h). A 
west-northwestward to northwestward motion is expected over the 
next day or so.  A slower northwestward to north-northwestward 
motion is forecast to begin on Thursday, and a northward motion is 
likely Thursday night and Friday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Delta will move over the northeastern portion of the 
Yucatan Peninsula this morning.  Delta is forecast to move over the 
southern Gulf of Mexico this afternoon, be over the southern or 
central Gulf of Mexico through Thursday, and approach the northern 
Gulf coast on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Although some additional weakening is likely when Delta 
moves over the Yucatan peninsula this morning, re-strengthening is 
forecast when the hurricane moves over the southern Gulf of Mexico 
Wednesday night and Thursday, and Delta could become a category 4 
hurricane again by late Thursday.  Weakening is expected as Delta 
approaches the northern Gulf coast on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).  A WeatherFlow observing site at Puerto Morelos, 
Mexico, has recently reported sustained winds of 54 mph (87 km/h) 
and a gust to 75 mph (122 km/h) after the passage of the center 
over that location.  A wind gust to 64 mph (104 km/h) was recently 
reported on Cozumel, Mexico. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 974 mb (28.76 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Delta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41
KNHC, and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels
in areas of onshore winds by as much as 6 to 9 ft above normal 
tide levels along the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from 
Cabo Catoche to Progreso, and 5 to 7 ft above normal tide levels 
along the eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Tulum to Cabo
Catoche.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  In the Yucatan Peninsula, dangerous hurricane conditions are 
expected in portions of the warning area during the next few hours, 
with tropical storm conditions already occuring.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning area to 
continue for the next several hours.  In Cuba, tropical storm 
conditions could continue over far western portions of the island 
during the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL:  Through early Thursday, Delta is expected to produce 4 to
6 inches of rain, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches, across
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula. This rainfall may result
in areas of significant flash flooding. In addition, 2 to 4 inches
of rain, with isolated higher amounts, are expected across portions
of western Cuba. This rainfall may result in areas of flash flooding
and mudslides.
 
Friday through Saturday, Delta is expected to produce 4 to 8 inches
of rain, with isolated maximum totals of 12 inches across portions
of the central Gulf Coast north into portions of the Lower
Mississippi Valley. These rainfall amounts will lead to flash,
urban, and small stream flooding, along with minor river flooding.
Heavy rainfall will eventually spread into the Tennessee Valley, and
interior southeastern United States this weekend into early next
week.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Delta will affect land areas around the
northwestern Caribbean Sea for the next day or so. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
