Explanation:

* 0 to 34 mph (0 to 55 km/h): Offshore gale force probability is not mentioned in the forecast, so it remains unchanged.
* 35 to 54 mph (56 to 87 km/h) and greater: In the forecast, gale force winds are expected within the next few hours. Therefore, the gale force probability is set to ""ON"" for the 96-hour forecast period. For the other time periods, it remains unchanged as the forecast does not provide information about gale force conditions for those times.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '0%', 'in 72h': '0%', 'in 96h': '0%'}"

"The image shows a bulletin from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) providing an update on Tropical Storm Elsa. According to the NHC, the center of Elsa was located near latitude 14.4 North, longitude 65.1 West at 800 PM AST (0000 UTC). The storm is moving toward the west-northwest near 30 mph (48 km/h) and this general motion is expected to continue through Saturday.

The maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h), with higher gusts. Little change in strength is forecast through Saturday, but slow weakening is expected to begin Saturday night or Sunday as Elsa interacts with Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Cuba.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km). The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.38 inches).

The bulletin advises that a storm surge will raise water levels above normal tide level by as much as the following amounts in areas of onshore flow within the hurricane watch and warning areas: southern coast of Cuba, southern coast of Hispaniola, Jamaica. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 15 inches are expected across the Windward and southern Leeward Islands.

Additionally, by early next week, Elsa is expected to impact portions of the Cayman Islands and Cuba producing 5 to 10 inches of rain, with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches. This rainfall may result in significant flash flooding and mudslides.

The bulletin also mentions that swells generated by Elsa will spread westward across the Caribbean Sea through the weekend, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. The next complete advisory is expected at 1100 PM AST.",None
