DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Michael was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near
latitude 20.1 North, longitude 85.5 West.  Michael is moving toward
the north near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A general northward motion with some
increase in forward speed is expected over the next few days.  On
the forecast track, the center of Michael will move over the Yucatan
Channel or extreme western Cuba today, cross the eastern Gulf of
Mexico later today through Tuesday night, and approach the United
States northeastern Gulf coast on Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is expected during the next few days,
and Michael is forecast to become a hurricane tonight or on
Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is
994 mb (29.35 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are likely beginning to spread
across portions of the Cuban coast within the warning area.
Tropical storm conditions are also very close to the coast of
Mexico within the warning area.

RAINFALL:  Michael is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 3 to 7 inches over western Cuba and 2 to 4 inches over the
Yucatan Peninsula and Belize through Tuesday.  Isolated maximum
amounts of 12 inches are possible in western Cuba.  This rainfall
could lead to life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in areas
of mountainous terrain.

Elsewhere, outer rain bands from Michael are expected to produce
total rain accumulations of 2 to 4 inches across the Florida Keys
through Tuesday.
