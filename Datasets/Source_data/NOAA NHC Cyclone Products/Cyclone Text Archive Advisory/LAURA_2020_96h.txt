DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Laura was
located by surface observations over southern Dominican Republic
near latitude 18.6 North, longitude 70.1 West. Laura is moving
toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general
motion is expected over the next few days.  On the forecast track,
the center of Laura will move across Hispaniola today, be near or
over Cuba Sunday night and Monday, and over the southeastern Gulf of
Mexico Monday night and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. No significant changes in strength are forecast during the
next 36 to 48 hours while Laura moves near or over Hispaniola and
Cuba. Strengthening is forecast once Laura moves into the Gulf of
Mexico Monday night and Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Laura is expected to produce the following rainfall
accumulations through Tuesday:
 
Dominican Republic and Haiti: 4 to 8 inches, with maximum amounts of
12 inches across southern areas.
 
Cuba: 3 to 6 inches, with isolated amounts of 8 inches.
 
This heavy rainfall could lead to life-threatening flash and urban
flooding, and the potential for mudslides across the Greater
Antilles. Widespread minor to potentially moderate river flooding
is still possible in Puerto Rico today.
 
Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches, with isolated maximum totals of
5 inches, is expected over the Turks and Caicos, southeast Bahamas
and Jamaica.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of
the warning area through Sunday night.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible within portions of the watch area on Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Laura are affecting portions of the
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola.  These swells are
expected to spread across Cuba, much of the Bahamas, and the
Florida Keys during the next few days. Please consult products
from your local weather office.
