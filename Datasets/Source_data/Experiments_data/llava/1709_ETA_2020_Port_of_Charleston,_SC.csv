The current status of the storm is that its center is near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 79.3 West, with winds of up to 65 mph (100 km/h). It is moving toward the northeast at 12 mph (19 km/h) and is expected to turn toward the north and northwest later today and tonight. On the forecast track, the center of Eta will move across central Cuba during the next few hours and then move into the Florida Straits later this morning.

Eta is forecast to pass near or over the Florida Keys tonight and early Monday and be over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico late Monday and Tuesday.

The storm has the potential to bring significant rainfall, with amounts ranging from 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm) in Jamaica, 5 to 10 inches (125 to 255 mm) in Cuba, and 4 to 8 inches (100 to 200 mm) in the northwestern Bahamas. Flash flooding is possible in these areas, with isolated maximum storm totals of up to 15 inches (380 mm).

A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of Cuba near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.

However, since the text is talking about a storm named Eta and its track over Florida, it is likely that the impact on freight at Port of Charleston would be during or after the time frame of the storm's movement in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and along the Florida peninsula.

The storm is forecast to become a hurricane as it moves near or over the Florida Keys tonight and early Monday, which suggests that the impact on freight at Port of Charleston could be expected around that time. However, this information does not provide an exact date for when the expected end of impact will occur.

Please note that this is a rough estimate based on the text you've given and other factors such as storm movement, intensity, and duration may affect the timeline. It would be advisable to check the latest updates from reliable sources to get accurate information regarding the impact of the storm on freight at Port of Charleston, SC.",None

"The image shows a tropical storm named Eta, which is moving towards the southwest and is expected to slow down and strengthen some tonight and Tuesday. The storm is currently located near latitude 23.7 North, longitude 84.8 West, and has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches). Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center of Eta.

The rainfall amounts expected for Eta through Saturday morning are: The Bahamas: An additional 1 to 2 inches (25 to 50 mm), with isolated maximum storm totals of 15 inches (380 mm). Portions of Cuba: an additional 3 to 5 inches (75 to 125 mm), isolated maximum storm total accumulations of 25 inches (635 mm). The Florida Keys and South Florida: an additional 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm), with isolated maximum storm totals of 18 inches (450 mm) in South Florida.

Flash flooding and river flooding will be possible in Cuba, along with landslides in areas of higher terrain. Additional flash flooding is possible across inundated urban areas of southeast Florida today. Flash and urban flooding will also be possible for the Bahamas and the remainder of southern and eastern Florida over the next several days.

Winds are expected to cause gusty conditions across the Florida Keys, south and central Florida, and the northwestern Bahamas today. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch area in Cuba tonight and Tuesday. Swells generated by Eta are expected to affect the north coast of Cuba, the northwestern Bahamas, southern Florida and the Florida Keys during the next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
