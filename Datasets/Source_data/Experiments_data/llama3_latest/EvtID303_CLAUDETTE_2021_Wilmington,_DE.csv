"Based on the provided information, there is no direct mention of Wilmington, DE or its expected start of impact on freight. However, I can help you analyze the given data.

According to the National Hurricane Center's Public Advisory and Track Forecast Cone, the system is expected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to the northern Gulf Coast starting later today (18th June).

Assuming this system will affect the East Coast, including Wilmington, DE, it's likely that the impact on freight at Wilmington, DE would be significant. However, I can't pinpoint an exact date or time frame for the start of impact.

As a cyclone and port operations analyst, I can suggest monitoring the weather updates and advisories from the National Weather Service (NWS) for more information about this system's trajectory and potential impacts on Wilmington, DE.

In summary, there is no specific date mentioned in the provided data for the expected start of impact on freight at Wilmington, DE.",6/18/2021
