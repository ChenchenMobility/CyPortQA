DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Henri was 
located near latitude 29.8 North, longitude 72.3 West. Henri is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A sharp turn 
to the northwest and north is anticipated on Friday, followed by an 
acceleration to the north and north-northeast on Saturday and 
Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Henri will remain well 
offshore of the east coast of the United States over the next couple 
of days, but it is forecast to be near or over southern New England 
on Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected during the next 12 
hours, but Henri is forecast to intensify into a hurricane by Friday 
night with additional strengthening expected this weekend. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Henri may produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches over
southeastern New England Sunday into Monday, with isolated maximum
totals near 8 inches. Heavy rainfall from Henri may result in areas
of flash, urban, and small stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Henri should continue to affect Bermuda
during the next day or so.  Swells are expected to increase across
much of the east coast of the U.S. and Atlantic Canada on Friday and
into the weekend.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
