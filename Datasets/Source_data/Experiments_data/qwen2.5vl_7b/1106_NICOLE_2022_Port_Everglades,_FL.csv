"Given the current weather conditions, vessels should be advised to avoid the immediate coast of the northwestern Bahamas and the east coast of Florida, as hurricane conditions are expected to develop in these areas. Additionally, due to the potential for storm surge and flooding, vessels should be cautious in areas near the coast, particularly in the St. Johns River and along the Gulf Coast, as these areas are at risk for significant water level rises and flooding.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
"Given the current weather conditions, vessels should be advised to maintain a safe distance from the coast, especially near the northwestern Bahamas and Florida, as hurricane conditions are possible by Wednesday night. Additionally, they should be prepared for potential storm surge flooding and large destructive waves along the immediate coast.",Vessels that want to stay in port must obtain Captain-of-the-Port permission and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to off-load and depart at least 24 h before hazardous winds should divert to another port.
"Given the current weather conditions, ocean-going and commercial vessels should exercise caution and avoid navigating into the hurricane warning area along the east coast of Florida, particularly near the mouth of the St. Johns River and the Fuller Warren Bridge, as these areas are expected to experience significant storm surge and flooding.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
"Given the current weather conditions, ocean-going and commercial vessels should exercise caution and adhere to the Hurricane Watch issued for the east coast of Florida from the Volusia/Brevard County Line to Hallandale Beach and for Lake Okeechobee.

"Port Everglades, FL should monitor the storm surge watch and prepare for potential flooding and high winds, as Nicole is expected to make landfall near the east coast of Florida, including the area around Port Everglades, by Wednesday night.",Ports and facilities remain open to all commercial traffic and may continue all transfer operations while Condition WHISKEY is in effect.
"Given the current weather conditions and the issuance of a Storm Surge Warning for North Palm Beach to Altamaha Sound, including the Mouth of the St. Johns River to Georgetown, it is likely that general vessel activity at Port Everglades, FL, will be restricted or advised to avoid the affected areas due to the potential for dangerous storm surge flooding and large destructive waves.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
"Given the current weather conditions and the issuance of a Hurricane Watch for the east coast of Florida, including Lake Okeechobee, general vessel activity at Port Everglades, FL, is likely to be restricted or delayed, with increased safety protocols and potential port closures or evacuations in place to ensure the safety of personnel and vessels.","All ocean-going vessels, barges and pleasure craft should plan to depart the port early to avoid bridge closures; mariners are reminded there are no safe havens and ports are safest when vessel inventory is at a minimum."
