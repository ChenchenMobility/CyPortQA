DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Paine was located
near latitude 22.0 North, longitude 115.4 West. Paine is moving
toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A motion toward the
north at a slower rate of forward speed is expected by Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Little change in intensity is expected
today.  Steady weakening is forecast to begin tonight and continue
through Wednesday, and Paine is expected to become a tropical storm
on Tuesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Hurricane Paine is expected to produce rainfall amounts
of 2 to 4 inches across the northern Baja California peninsula with
