DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Laura was
located near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 81.6 West. Laura is
moving toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this
general motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected over
the next day or so.  A turn toward the northwest is forecast by
Wednesday, and a northwestward to north-northwestward motion should
continue through Wednesday night.  On the forecast track, the center
of Laura will move over the Caribbean Sea just offshore of the
southern coast of Cuba this afternoon, cross western Cuba this
evening, and move into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico overnight.
Laura is then forecast to move over the central and northwestern
Gulf of Mexico Tuesday night and Wednesday, and approach the
northwestern coast of the Gulf of Mexico Wednesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast today, but
strengthening is expected when the storm moves over the Gulf of
Mexico. Laura is foreast to become a hurricane on Tuesday, with
additional strengthening forecast on Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
primarily to the northeast and east of the center.  An elevated 
observing site at Sand Key located south of Key West, Florida, has 
recently reported a wind gust of 41 mph (67 km/h).  A wind gust of 
47 mph (76 km/h) has been observed at Santa Clara, Cuba, within the 
past few hours. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on reconnaissance
aircraft data is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Laura can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Laura is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall accumulations through today:
 
Jamaica, Cuba and the Cayman Islands: 4 to 6 inches, with maximum
amounts of 10 inches. Across the Greater Antilles this heavy
rainfall could lead to life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
and the potential for mudslides.
 
From Wednesday afternoon into Friday, Laura is expected to produce
rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 12
inches across portions of the west-central U.S. Gulf Coast near the
Texas and Louisiana border north into portions of the lower
Mississippi Valley.  This rainfall could cause widespread flash and
urban flooding, small streams to overflow their banks, and minor to
isolated moderate river flooding.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread westward
within the warning area in Cuba through today. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in Little Cayman and Cayman Brac today.
Tropical storm conditions are also expected within the warning area
in the middle and lower Florida Keys and the Dry Tortugas this
afternoon and tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Laura are affecting portions of
Hispaniola, Cuba, the central Bahamas, and the Florida Keys. Swells
are expected to spread northward along portions of the west coast of
Florida peninsula and the coast of the Florida panhandle on Tuesday
and Tuesday night. These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  An isolated tornado will be possible later today into
tonight across the Florida Keys.
