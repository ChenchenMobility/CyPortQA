DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eight
was located near latitude 25.9 North, longitude 88.2 West.  The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 6 mph, and this 
general motion is expected during the next few days.  On the 
forecast track, the center of the depression is expected to move 
across the northwestern Gulf of Mexico on Thursday and Friday and 
make landfall along the Texas coast on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow strengthening is expected, and the depression could become a 
tropical storm in a day or so.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by late Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  The depression is expected to produce 2 to 4 inches of 
rain with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches along the Gulf coast 
from Louisiana to the Lower Texas coast, and inland through 
south-central Texas and the Rio Grande Valley.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to increase
and affect much of the Texas and Louisiana coasts in a day or two.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
