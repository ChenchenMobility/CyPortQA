DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM EST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eta was
located near latitude 25.2 North, longitude 82.0 West. Eta is moving
toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A west to west-
southwest motion with some reduction in forward speed is expected
later today and tonight. Little overall motion is expected on
Tuesday and a slow northward motion is forecast on Wednesday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Eta will gradually pull away from
the Florida Keys and south Florida today and be over the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico tonight through Wednesday.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft and National Weather
Service Doppler radar indicate that the maximum sustained winds
remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher gusts. Some strengthening
is forecast during the next day or so, and Eta is forecast to become
a hurricane when it moves over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface
observations is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Eta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC, and on the
web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Eta is expected to produce the following rainfall amounts
through Saturday morning:
 
Jamaica and The Bahamas: An additional 2 to 4 inches (25 to 75 mm),
with isolated maximum storm totals of 15 inches (380 mm).
 
Portions of Cuba: an additional 3 to 5 inches (75 to 125 mm),
isolated maximum storm total accumulations of 25 inches (635 mm).
 
Portions of the central and southern Florida peninsula, including
the Keys: an additional 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm), with isolated
maximum storm totals of 18 inches (450 mm) in South Florida.
 
Flash flooding and river flooding will be possible in Cuba, along
with landslides in areas of higher terrain.  Life-threatening flash
flooding will be possible across inundated urban areas of southeast
Florida.  Flash and urban flooding will also be possible for
Jamaica, the Bahamas, and the remainder of southern and eastern
Florida over the next several days.  Minor river flooding is also
possible for central Florida.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Bonita Beach, FL to Card Sound Bridge including Florida Keys... 2-3
ft
Card Sound Bridge to Golden Beach... 1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions will continue across the Florida
Keys, south and central Florida, and the northwestern Bahamas
today.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical
Storm Watch area in Cuba tonight and Tuesday.
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible through tonight over
parts of south Florida and the Keys.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Eta are expected to affect the north
coast of Cuba, the northwestern Bahamas, southern Florida and the
Florida Keys during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
