Note: The gale force probability (34kt) is an estimation of the likelihood that gale-force winds (34 knots or greater) will occur at a given location and time in the future. This value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents no chance and 1 represents certainty. The specific values for each time period are based on the forecast provided by the National Weather Service and are calculated using a linear interpolation between the minimum and maximum probabilities.","{'in 12h': '10%', 'in 24h': '21%', 'in 48h': '3%', 'in 72h': '2%', 'in 96h': '0%'}"
