"A nice straightforward question!

According to the forecast data provided, the cumulative probabilities for Lake Charles Harbor District, LA are:

* Day 1: 8%
* Day 2: 17%
* Day 3: 19%
* Day 4: 6%
* Day 5: 3%

To get the cumulative probability within the next 5 days, I'll add up these values:

8 + 17 + 19 + 6 + 3 = **53%**

So, the answer is: **53**",72%
"According to the text, the cumulative probabilities are:

* Day 1: X (not given)
* Day 2: 6/11
* Day 3: 30/41
* Day 4: 1/5
* Day 5: X (not given)

To calculate the cumulative probability within the next 5 days, we can add up the probabilities for each day:

(0/10) + (6/11) + (30/41) + (1/5) = ?

Let's convert all probabilities to decimals and add them up:
0.00 + 0.54 + 0.73 + 0.20 = 1.47

So, the cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Lake Charles Harbor District, LA within the next 5 days is approximately **1.47**.",63%

* However, we can calculate the cumulative probability based on the 34-kt and 64-kt wind probabilities.
