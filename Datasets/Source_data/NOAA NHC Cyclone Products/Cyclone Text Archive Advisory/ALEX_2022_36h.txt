HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone One can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?key_messages.
 
RAINFALL: The Potential Tropical Cyclone is expected to produce
heavy rains over the eastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula, the
Cayman Islands and western Cuba through Friday.  Heavy rains will
begin to affect South Florida and the Keys Friday and continue
through Saturday. The following storm total rainfall amounts are
currently expected:
 
Eastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula and the Cayman Islands: 2
to 4 inches, with isolated maximum of 6 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with isolated maximum of 14 inches.
This rain may cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
 
South Florida including the Keys:  4 to 8 inches with maximum totals
of 12 inches.  This rain may produce considerable flash and urban
flooding especially across the urban corridors.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area in Cuba on Friday, and in the watch area in Florida and the 
northwestern Bahamas by Friday night or Saturday morning.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Marco Island, FL to Card Sound Bridge...1-3 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Marco Island, FL...1-2 ft
Charlotte Harbor...1-2 ft
Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas...1-2 ft
 
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
