"The image provided shows a track forecast cone from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), which indicates the expected path of a tropical cyclone (storm). However, it does not provide specific coordinates for the current eye of the storm within the cone. Typically, a hurricane's eye is located near the center of its wind field and is surrounded by the most intense part of the storm. The location of the eye can change as the storm moves over land or water.","37.4N, 74.8W"
"The image does not provide the exact coordinates for the current eye of the tropical cyclone. It shows a weather map that includes an area affected by a tropical storm. The map is labeled with ""Tropical Storm Fay"" and indicates the potential path and forecast track of the storm, which is expected to make landfall in the northeastern United States.

"The image provided shows wind speed probabilities for various locations in the Northeast United States. Based on the information given in the question, there is no location named ""Mobile"" listed in the image. It appears that the wind speed probabilities are only provided for select locations on the East Coast of the United States.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to your question as it pertains to a location that is not included in the information given.",0%

"The 34-kt wind probability peak at Mobile, AL is at 12Z Fri (July 10). To find out how many hours remain until this peak, we need to convert the time from UTC to AST (Eastern Standard Time), which is a 4-hour difference. So, we subtract 4 hours from 12Z Fri:

12Z Fri - 4 hours = 08Z Fri (July 10)

Now, we check the wind speed probability table for Mobile, AL at this time (08Z Fri). In the ""FORECAST HOUR"" column, we see that the peak of the 34-kt wind probability occurs at 12Z Fri. Since there is no information provided for 08Z Fri, we can assume that the peak has not yet occurred.

To find out how many hours remain until the peak occurs, we subtract the current time (08Z Fri) from the time of the peak (12Z Fri):

12Z Fri - 08Z Fri = 4 hours

So, there are 4 hours remaining until the 34-kt wind probability peak at Mobile, AL within the next 5 days.",N/A
