"The question asks about Texas City, TX. However, Texas City, TX is not explicitly listed in the provided ""WIND SPEED PROBABILITY TABLE FOR SELECTED LOCATIONS.""

Let's analyze the closest available locations and the probabilities for 34-kt winds:

*   **Galveston TX:** The highest 34-kt probability is 2% for the 12-24 hour period (06Z SAT to 18Z SAT).
*   **Freeport TX:** The highest 34-kt probability is 3% for the 24-48 hour period (18Z SAT to 06Z SUN).
*   **High Island TX:** The highest 34-kt probability is 2% for the 24-48 hour period (18Z SAT to 06Z SUN).

Given that Texas City is situated between Galveston and Freeport along the Texas coast, and considering the options provided, we need to infer the most likely scenario.

Let's re-examine the options:
A. 0-12 hours (from 18Z FRI to 06Z SAT)
B. 12-24 Hours (from 06Z SAT to 18Z SAT)
C. 24-48 hours (from 18Z SAT to 06Z SUN)
D. 48 hours or more (from 06Z SUN onwards)

Looking at Galveston:
*   0-12 hours: 1%
*   12-24 hours: 1% (cumulative) - *Note: The onset probability for 12-24 hours is 1% which leads to a cumulative of 2% by 18Z Sat. The question asks for the interval.*
*   24-48 hours: X% (cumulative)

Looking at Freeport:
*   0-12 hours: 1%
*   12-24 hours: 1% (cumulative)
*   24-48 hours: X% (cumulative)

It appears there might be a misunderstanding or missing information regarding the specific location ""Texas City, TX"" within the provided table. However, based on the available data and the general progression of the storm, we can infer the following trend for coastal locations.

Let's look at the cumulative probabilities for the closest points:

**Galveston TX (34 kt):**
*   06Z SAT (cumulative): 2%
*   18Z SAT (cumulative): 4%
*   06Z SUN (cumulative): 4%

**Freeport TX (34 kt):**
*   06Z SAT (cumulative): 2%
*   18Z SAT (cumulative): 5%
*   06Z SUN (cumulative): 5%

The question asks for the *highest probability* within a *time interval*. The table provides probabilities for the *start* of the interval (Onset Probability - OP) and the *cumulative* probability up to the end of the interval (Cumulative Probability - CP). We need to consider the probabilities within each interval.

Let's interpret the probabilities more carefully for Galveston (34 kt):
*   Interval 1 (18Z FRI to 06Z SAT, 12 hours): OP = 1% (meaning a 1% chance of winds reaching 34 kt *during* this period)
*   Interval 2 (06Z SAT to 18Z SAT, 12 hours): OP = 1% (meaning a 1% chance of winds reaching 34 kt *during* this period, in addition to the previous period). The CP is 2%, meaning by 06Z SAT, the cumulative probability was 1% and by 18Z SAT, it is 2%. So, the probability *during* the 06Z to 18Z interval is 1%.
*   Interval 3 (18Z SAT to 06Z SUN, 24 hours): OP = X% (less than 1%)

Let's re-examine the question: ""Which forecasted time interval indicates the highest 34-kt wind probability for Texas City, TX?""

Given the available data for Galveston and Freeport, and looking at the options:

A. 0-12 hours (18Z FRI to 06Z SAT): Galveston 1%, Freeport 1%.
B. 12-24 Hours (06Z SAT to 18Z SAT): Galveston 1%, Freeport 1%.
C. 24-48 hours (18Z SAT to 06Z SUN): Galveston X%, Freeport X%.

This interpretation still doesn't highlight a clear peak. Let's re-read the table definition:
""PROBABILITIES FOR LOCATIONS ARE GIVEN AS OP(CP) WHERE OP IS THE PROBABILITY OF THE EVENT BEGINNING DURING AN INDIVIDUAL TIME PERIOD"".

This means OP is the probability of the event *starting* in that specific interval. The CP is the cumulative probability up to the *end* of that interval.

Let's consider the OP values for the *intervals*:
*   **Galveston TX (34 kt):**
    *   Interval 1 (18Z FRI to 06Z SAT): OP = 1%
    *   Interval 2 (06Z SAT to 18Z SAT): OP = 1%
    *   Interval 3 (18Z SAT to 06Z SUN): OP = X% (less than 1%)
    *   Interval 4 (06Z SUN to 18Z SUN): OP = X%

*   **Freeport TX (34 kt):**
    *   Interval 1 (18Z FRI to 06Z SAT): OP = 1%
    *   Interval 2 (06Z SAT to 18Z SAT): OP = 1%
    *   Interval 3 (18Z SAT to 06Z SUN): OP = X%
    *   Interval 4 (06Z SUN to 18Z SUN): OP = X%

There appears to be an issue with the question or the provided data if Texas City is indeed meant to be a distinct entry. However, if we are to pick the *highest* probability from the listed options based on the closest points, we would look at the highest OP values.

Let's re-evaluate the cumulative aspect. The question asks for the ""highest 34-kt wind probability"". It doesn't specify ""onset"" probability. It is more likely asking about the probability of experiencing those winds during that period.

Let's look at the cumulative probabilities (CP) as they represent the overall chance of experiencing winds up to that point.
*   **Galveston TX (34 kt):**
    *   CP by 06Z SAT (end of first interval): 2%
    *   CP by 18Z SAT (end of second interval): 4%
    *   CP by 06Z SUN (end of third interval): 4%

*   **Freeport TX (34 kt):**
    *   CP by 06Z SAT (end of first interval): 2%
    *   CP by 18Z SAT (end of second interval): 5%
    *   CP by 06Z SUN (end of third interval): 5%

The highest cumulative probability for 34-kt winds for the closest locations (Galveston and Freeport) occurs by 18Z SAT, which is the end of the second interval (12-24 hours). This means the highest probability of *having experienced* those winds is by the end of that period.

However, the question asks for the *interval*. Let's consider the probability *within* each interval.

If we consider the chance of winds occurring *during* the interval, we can look at the difference in cumulative probabilities.

*   **Galveston TX (34 kt):**
    *   Interval 1 (18Z FRI to 06Z SAT): Probability of starting is 1%. Cumulative by end is 2%. This means the probability of winds being at least 34kt *during* this interval is 1%.
    *   Interval 2 (06Z SAT to 18Z SAT): Probability of starting is 1%. Cumulative by end is 4%. This means the probability of winds being at least 34kt *during* this interval is 4% - 2% = 2%.
    *   Interval 3 (18Z SAT to 06Z SUN): Probability of starting is X%. Cumulative by end is 4%. This means the probability of winds being at least 34kt *during* this interval is 4% - 4% = 0% or less than 1%.

*   **Freeport TX (34 kt):**
    *   Interval 1 (18Z FRI to 06Z SAT): Probability of starting is 1%. Cumulative by end is 2%. Probability *during* this interval is 1%.
    *   Interval 2 (06Z SAT to 18Z SAT): Probability of starting is 1%. Cumulative by end is 5%. Probability *during* this interval is 5% - 2% = 3%.
    *   Interval 3 (18Z SAT to 06Z SUN): Probability of starting is X%. Cumulative by end is 5%. Probability *during* this interval is 5% - 5% = 0% or less than 1%.

Based on this interpretation, the interval with the highest probability of experiencing 34-kt winds for the closest locations (Freeport) is the 12-24 hour interval (06Z SAT to 18Z SAT), with a probability of 3%.

Let's check other locations that might be relevant to the Texas coast.

*   **Port O Connor (34 kt):**
    *   Interval 1 (18Z FRI to 06Z SAT): OP = 2%
    *   Interval 2 (06Z SAT to 18Z SAT): OP = 19%
    *   Interval 3 (18Z SAT to 06Z SUN): OP = 8%

For Port O Connor, the highest probability of *onset* is in the 12-24 hour interval (06Z SAT to 18Z SAT) with 19%. This interval aligns with option B.

Let's assume Texas City would have similar probabilities to its neighboring coastal cities. Port O Connor shows the highest probability for the 12-24 hour interval.

Final check:
*   A. 0-12 hours (18Z FRI to 06Z SAT): Highest OP for closest points is 2% (Port O Connor).
*   B. 12-24 Hours (06Z SAT to 18Z SAT): Highest OP for closest points is 19% (Port O Connor).
*   C. 24-48 hours (18Z SAT to 06Z SUN): Highest OP for closest points is 8% (Port O Connor).
*   D. 48 hours or more: Probabilities drop to X%.

The interval 12-24 hours shows the highest probability of onset for a coastal location, which is likely representative of Texas City.
