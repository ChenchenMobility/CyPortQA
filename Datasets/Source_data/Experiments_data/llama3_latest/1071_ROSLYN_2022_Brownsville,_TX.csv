"According to the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, I estimate that approximately **12** hours will pass before the cyclone reaches its projected landfall point.",18

"According to the Track Forecast Cone from National Hurricane Center, I will analyze the current position and the projected landfall of the cyclone.

**Current Position:** 25°N, 75°W (Location A)
**Projected Landfall:** 30°N, 80°E (Location B)

Using the coordinates, I estimate the distance between Location A and Location B to be approximately 550 nautical miles.

**Time Estimation:**

Assuming a moderate forward speed of the cyclone at 15 knots (27.8 km/h), I calculate the expected time elapsing before landfall:

Time = Distance / Forward Speed
= 550 nautical miles / 15 knots
= 36.67 hours

Rounding to the nearest hour, I output: **37**",54
