At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Three

and meander over the southern Bay of Campeche through late
Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of the cyclone is
forecast to be near the coast of the southern Bay of Campeche
Tuesday night through Thursday.
 
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained
winds have increased near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is expected during the next couple of days and
the depression is forecast to become a tropical storm later today.
