**Explanation:**

The forecast includes potential for ""considerable flash, urban, small stream, and riverine flooding impacts"" and ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"" along the Gulf Coast, specifically mentioning New Orleans. This level of disruption would likely impact commercial vessel operations significantly, suggesting a large number of vessels would be affected. Given the average daily vessel count, a disruption leading to a substantial impact is highly probable.",D.
D. 20 vessels or more,D.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The forecast suggests the depression will approach the U.S. northern Gulf Coast on Sunday, bringing potential impacts. While the advisory doesn's provide a definitive number, the potential for impacts on a major port like New Orleans, coupled with the forecast track, suggests a significant disruption and a higher-than-average number of vessels affected.",D.
