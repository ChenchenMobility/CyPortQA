Since there is no specific location provided, we can assume the gale force probability for the entire affected area. Based on the given information, it appears that there will be a cyclone affecting the coast of North Carolina in the near future. However, since the depression is stationary and little motion is expected during the next 2 or 3 days, it is not possible to accurately predict the gale force probability for specific locations and time periods. It would require more information about the potential track and intensity of the cyclone to make a more informed prediction.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '2%', 'in 72h': '3%', 'in 96h': '3%'}"

Explanation: The gale force probability (34kt) is based on the forecast for Tropical Depression Three becoming a tropical storm, with gradual strengthening expected through Monday. It is estimated to become a tropical storm on Saturday, with winds reaching 34 knots (gale force). Therefore, the highest gale force probability of 70% is at the 24-hour mark, as it is closer to the time when the depression is forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm. The probability gradually decreases in the subsequent hours as the storm moves offshore and loses intensity.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '1%', 'in 48h': '10%', 'in 72h': '16%', 'in 96h': '32%'}"
