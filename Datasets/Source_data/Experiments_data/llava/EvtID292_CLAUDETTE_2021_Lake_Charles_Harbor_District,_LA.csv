There are no additional hazards at this location.,"An isolated tornado cannot be ruled out in the broader region, but the immediate port risk is low."
"Additional hazards at Lake Charles Harbor District, LA, may include potential flooding from nearby waterways, such as the Calcasieu River or Sabine River, which could be exacerbated by storm surge if it makes landfall.","Isolated tornado risk, frequent lightning, brief squalls reducing visibility for vessel operations"

"The image shows a tropical disturbance named ""Potential Tropical Cyclone Three,"" which is approaching the northern Gulf Coast region and is forecast to become a tropical or subtropical storm before landfall later tonight or early Saturday. It is expected to make landfall along the north-central Gulf Coast and move northeast across the southeastern United States through the weekend.

The disturbance has already begun producing heavy rainfall, with rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches predicted for portions of the Central Gulf Coast, including East of Morgan City, Louisiana to the Okaloosa/Walton County line in Florida. Flash, urban and small stream flooding impacts are likely due to these heavy rains.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) from the center of the disturbance. The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations and Air Force Hurricane Hunter data is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).

The potential tropical cyclone will cause storm surge, which could result in flooding along the coast. In addition to this, there is a threat for a tornado or two tonight across coastal Louisiana.

For more detailed and localized information about the storm's impact on freight at Lake Charles Harbor District, LA, please monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.",None

The current advisory indicates that there is a high probability of formation within the next two days and a high probability of formation through five days. The system is expected to move toward the northeast across the southeastern United States after landfall. Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts, and some strengthening is forecast tonight and Friday. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches are possible beginning Friday and continuing through the weekend across the northern Gulf Coast northeastward into the Southern Appalachians, which will likely produce areas of flash, urban, and small stream flooding as well as minor to isolated moderate river flooding with new and renewed rises on already elevated rivers. The storm surge could reach 2-3 feet above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide. Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the warning area on Friday, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous. There is a threat for a couple tornadoes across coastal Louisiana on Friday afternoon, which should expand northward across southern portions of Louisiana and Mississippi, and southwest Alabama on Saturday. The next advisory is predicted at 700 PM CDT.",None
