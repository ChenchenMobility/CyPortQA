"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory mentions ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"" affecting the entire East Coast, including the New York/New Jersey area. Given the severe weather and potential for disruptions, it's highly likely that a significant number of commercial vessels would be affected, leading to delays, rerouting, or temporary port closures. Considering the average daily vessel traffic of over 30, a disruption affecting 20 or more vessels seems plausible given the described hazards and potential port impacts.",A.
"Based on the provided text, there's no mention of commercial vessels or impact on New York/New Jersey ports. The text focuses on storm surge, rainfall, and general coastal hazards. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the number of impacted vessels.

Given the lack of information, the most reasonable answer is **A. None**.",A.
