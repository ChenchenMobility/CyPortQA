"The provided data does not include information for South Jersey Port Corp, NJ. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given data.

If the question is hypothetical and we are to assume that South Jersey Port Corp, NJ should have been included but was mistakenly omitted, we would need additional information to provide an accurate answer. However, based on the format of the provided data, it appears that the probabilities are given in increments of time (0 hours), 0-24 Hours, 24-48 hours, and 48 hours or more.

Given that the question asks when the probability first rises above zero, we can infer that the correct answer would be:
