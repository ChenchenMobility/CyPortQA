"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory mentions potential impacts from Zeta, including storm surge, wind, and rainfall, which would severely disrupt port operations. Given the predicted intensity of the storm and the region's vulnerability, it's highly probable that a significant number of vessels would be affected, leading to delays or diversions. Assuming a conservative estimate, it's reasonable to suggest that 20 or more vessels could be impacted over the course of the entire event.",C.
D. 20 vessels or more,C.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The advisory highlights significant hazards (storm surge, rainfall, winds) impacting the Gulf Coast, including South Louisiana. Given the severity of the predicted conditions, it's highly probable that commercial vessel operations would be significantly disrupted, leading to a substantial reduction in the number of vessels at port. A complete shutdown or a very limited number of vessels is likely, pushing the number significantly below the daily average.",C.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Reasoning:**

The advisory indicates potential hurricane conditions and storm surge impacting the northern Gulf Coast, including South Louisiana. Given the potential for severe weather, ports would likely issue warnings and restrictions, leading to a significant disruption of vessel traffic. While a precise number is impossible to determine without specific port data, a disruption severe enough to impact a region with an average daily vessel count of over 35 would reasonably lead to at least 20 vessels being affected over the event's duration.",C.
"D. 20 vessels or more



**Explanation:**

The forecast discussion mentions the potential for rainfall and storm conditions impacting the central U.S. Gulf Coast, including South Louisiana. Given the potential for significant disruption, it's reasonable to expect a substantial number of vessels to be affected, exceeding 20.",C.
