Based on the text, there are no specific times or dates mentioned for Wilmington, DE. However, if you're referring to the 34-kt wind probability, it seems that the maximum value is expected at Wilmington, DE, which is in Delaware, not North Carolina (Wilmington, NC).

Assuming you meant Wilmington, DE, I found no information suggesting a peak or maximum value for the 34-kt wind probability within the next 5 days. If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify anything else, please feel free to ask!
