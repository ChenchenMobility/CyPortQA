"A. None



**Explanation:**

The provided text focuses on storm surge, rainfall, and potential tornado threats. It doesn't mention any specific disruptions to port operations or a predicted number of impacted vessels at Canaveral. While the storm will undoubtedly cause some impact, the provided information doesn't quantify that impact in terms of vessel numbers. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume no data and therefore no impact from the storm.",A.
,A.
"Here's how we can determine the answer based on the provided text:

*   **Elsa's Impact:** The advisory indicates Elsa will bring tropical storm conditions to the Florida Keys and the west coast of Florida, including the area around Canaveral Port District.
*   **Port Operations:** Tropical storm conditions typically lead to port closures or reduced operations to ensure safety.
*   **Duration of Impact:** The advisory states the conditions will last from tonight into Tuesday, and that ""s swells will increase near the Florida Keys and south Florida later today and spread northward along the west coast of Florida tonight and Tuesday."" Therefore, there will be impact over a 36-48 hour window.
*   **Average Daily Vessels:** The average is given as 2.208396714 vessels.

Given the likely closure or significant disruption of port operations, it's reasonable to expect a significant reduction in vessel traffic. While some vessels might attempt to enter or exit the port, the overall number will likely be substantially lower than average. The timeframe of 36-48 hours means that the impact period is long enough to prevent any significant number of vessels getting through.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**A. None**",A.
,A.
,A.
"Based on the provided text, it's impossible to determine the total number of impacted commercial vessels at Canaveral Port District. The information focuses on storm warnings, rainfall predictions, and potential hazards, but doesn't provide any data on vessel counts or disruptions.

Therefore, the answer is **A. None** because there's no information to suggest any impact on vessels.",A.
,A.
,A.
A. None,A.
