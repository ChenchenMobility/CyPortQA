"The forecast is not readily available in this format to determine the answer. However, I can help you understand how to find the information.

To find out when the 50-knot wind probability will peak and for how many hours it remains until then, you'll need to analyze the forecasted wind probabilities at Port of Brunswick, GA for the next 5 days.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Identify the time period where the 50-kt wind probability is highest.
2. Determine the starting time of this peak period (e.g., 10:00 AM on a specific date).
3. Check the forecasted wind probabilities at Port of Brunswick, GA for every hour within the next 5 days, starting from the identified peak time.
4. Count the number of hours until the 50-kt wind probability starts to decrease below its peak value.

Please note that you'll need access to a weather forecasting tool or software that provides detailed wind probability forecasts to complete this task accurately.",96
