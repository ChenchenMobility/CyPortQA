"**D. 20 vessels or more**

**Reasoning:**

The advisory mentions potential impacts in the northwestern Bahamas, which are close to Jacksonville, FL. Given the storm's expected path and the potential for tropical storm conditions, it's highly likely that vessel traffic in and around Jacksonville would be significantly disrupted. A storm of this magnitude would necessitate rerouting or delaying numerous ships, leading to a substantial impact on the average daily vessel count.",A.
