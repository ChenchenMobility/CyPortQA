D. 20 vessels or more,D.
D. 20 vessels or more,D.
The correct answer is D. 20 vessels or more.,D.
D. 20 vessels or more,D.
"The correct answer is D. 20 vessels or more.

According to the provided forecast information, Tropical Storm Beta is expected to slowly approach the Texas coast into early next week, and Corpus Christi, TX is likely to experience a significant impact from the storm surge and strong winds. Given the intensity of the storm and its proximity to the city, it is reasonable to expect that more than 20 commercial vessels may be impacted during the entire event.

Based on the average number of vessels daily (18.00091269), we can estimate the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at Corpus Christi, TX over the entire event as follows:

* Average number of vessels daily: 18.00091269
* Total number of days the storm is expected to impact the area: assume 3-4 days (based on the forecast track and speed)
* Total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels: approximately 54.002 to 72.003 vessels

This estimate falls within the range of ""20 vessels or more"" in option D, making it the most likely correct answer.",D.
The answer is C. 10-20 vessels.,D.
"Based on the text, there is no information provided about commercial vessels at Corpus Christi, TX, and therefore it's impossible to determine the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. None",D.
D. 20 vessels or more,D.
B. 10-20 vessels,D.
