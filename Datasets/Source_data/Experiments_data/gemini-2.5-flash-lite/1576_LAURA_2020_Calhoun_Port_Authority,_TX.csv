Tornadoes are expected.,Dangerous rip currents and large swells may affect vessel operations and channel pilotage even though the storm core remains well east
"No additional hazards are mentioned for Calhoun Port Authority, TX, excluding rainfall, wind, and storm surge.",Dangerous surf and rip currents through Thursday; isolated tornado risk shifts inland well northeast of the port
The storm may cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,"Rough seas, dangerous rip currents, and short-period halts to cargo operations likely Wednesday night through Thursday."
Rip currents.,Rough seas and dangerous rip currents in Matagorda Bay and near-shore Gulf waters may disrupt vessel movements.
"No additional hazards are mentioned for Calhoun Port Authority, TX, excluding rainfall, wind, and storm surge.",High seas and dangerous rip currents in approaches; possible port access restrictions beginning late Wednesday
Tornadoes are possible.,High seas and dangerous surf beginning late Tuesday will likely shut down vessel movements; potential for minor coastal flooding during high tide.
No additional hazards are mentioned.,Very rough seas and higher-than-normal tides could halt vessel movements and cargo operations
"No additional hazards are mentioned for Calhoun Port Authority, TX.",None anticipated beyond minor marine/sea-state deterioration along the middle Texas coast.
Rip currents.,Elevated seas and minor coastal flooding could disrupt vessel movements even if direct storm impacts remain east of the port
"No additional hazards are mentioned for Calhoun Port Authority, TX, beyond those already excluded.",None
