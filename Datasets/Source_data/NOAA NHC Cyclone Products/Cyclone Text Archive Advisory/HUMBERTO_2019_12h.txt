DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Humberto was
located near latitude 25.6 North, longitude 75.2 West. Humberto is
moving toward the northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h). A turn toward the
north-northwest is expected by Sunday, with a slower northward
motion forecast to occur by Monday.  On the forecast track, the
system is anticipated to move very near the northwestern Bahamas
on Saturday, and offshore of the east coast of Florida this weekend
and early next week.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast, and Humberto is
expected to become a hurricane in two or three days.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the NOAA
Hurricane Hunters is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area in the northwestern Bahamas by early Saturday.

RAINFALL: The depression is expected to produce these total rainfall
accumulations through Sunday:

The Bahamas...2 to 4 inches, isolated maximum amounts 6 inches.
The U.S. Atlantic Coast from central Florida into South
Carolina...2 to 4 inches.

STORM SURGE: This system is not expected to product significant
storm surge in the northwestern Bahamas.

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to increase
and effect the coasts of Central Florida to South Carolina late
this weekend and early next week.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
