DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hanna was
located by a NOAA reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 27.1 North,
longitude 92.8 West.  Hanna is moving toward the west-northwest near
9 mph (15 km/h) and a turn toward the west is expected tonight,
followed by a generally westward motion through the weekend.  On the
forecast track, the storm center should make landfall along the
Texas coast within the warning area on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual strengthening is expected until the tropical cyclone
makes landfall. Steady weakening is expected after Hanna moves
inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center. During the past few hours, a buoy located east of 
the center reported a sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a gust 
to 52 mph (83 km/h).
 
Reports from the NOAA reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the
minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
by tonight or Saturday morning.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area by tonight or Saturday morning.
 
RAINFALL: Hanna is expected to produce 4 to 8 inches of rain with
isolated maximum totals of 12 inches through Sunday night in south
Texas.  This rain may result in life-threatening flash flooding,
rapid rises on small streams, and isolated minor to moderate river
flooding in south Texas.  3 to 5 inches of rain is expected along
the upper Texas and Louisiana coasts, and inland to the Mexican
states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and northern Tamaulipas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Hanna are expected to increase and affect
much of the Texas and Louisiana coasts during the next few days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
