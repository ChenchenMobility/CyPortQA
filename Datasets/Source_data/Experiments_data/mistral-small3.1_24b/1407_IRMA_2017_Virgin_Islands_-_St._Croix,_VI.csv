"The data provided does not include information for Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine when the probability of 34-kt winds rises above zero for that location.

However, if we need to choose an answer from the given options (A, B, C, or D), we would need to infer based on the closest available data or typical patterns, which is not advisable without proper data. Since the question specifically asks for the first time the probability rises above zero and we don't have the data, we cannot provide a safe and conservative answer would be:

"The data provided does not include specific information for Virgin Islands - St. Croix, VI. However, based on the format and the data for other locations, we can infer the timing for when the probability of 34-kt winds rises above zero.

Given the structure of the data, it appears that the probabilities for various time intervals are listed. For many locations, the first non-zero probability often appears in the ""0-24 Hours"" column. Since the question asks for the first time the probability rises above zero, we can deduce that it would likely be in the ""0-24 Hours"" column if it were provided.
