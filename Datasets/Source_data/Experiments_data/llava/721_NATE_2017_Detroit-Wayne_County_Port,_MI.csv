"The image shows a weather forecast for Tropical Depression Sixteen, and it mentions that the storm is moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and should be nearing the coast of Nicaragua early Thursday, move across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras late Thursday, and emerge into the northwestern Caribbean Sea on Friday. It is expected to become a tropical storm overnight. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches), and maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. The depression is forecast to produce rain accumulations of 15 to 20 inches in Nicaragua, isolated 30 inches, 5 to 10 inches in Costa Rica and Panama, and 2 to 5 inches in Honduras, with isolated 8 inches. Swells generated by the cyclone are affecting portions of the coast of Nicaragua, and will begin to affect other land areas around the northwestern Caribbean later this week. The next complete advisory is expected at 1100 PM EDT.",None
