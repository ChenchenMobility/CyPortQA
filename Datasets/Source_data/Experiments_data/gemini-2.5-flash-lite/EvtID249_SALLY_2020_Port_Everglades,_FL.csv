"The image shows the probability of tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Sally. The storm center is located in the Gulf of Mexico, west of Florida and south of Alabama and Mississippi. The color-coded bands indicate the probability of wind speeds. The innermost band, representing the highest probability of strong winds, is centered on the storm.

Let's analyze the options:
A. Tampa Port Authority, FL: Tampa is on the west coast of Florida, south of the storm's current projected path. The probabilities of strong winds reaching Tampa within the forecast period appear low, as the storm is moving northwestward.

B. Houston Port Authority, TX: Houston is located west of the storm's projected path. While there is some probability of winds, it is not the highest.

C. Port of Brunswick, GA: Brunswick is on the coast of Georgia, far to the northeast of the storm's current position and projected path. The probabilities of strong winds reaching Brunswick are very low.

D. Port Everglades, FL: Port Everglades is located on the southeastern coast of Florida. The storm is currently west of Florida and moving northwest. There is a low probability of strong winds reaching Port Everglades within the forecast period, as the storm is not projected to move in that direction.

Looking at the graphic, the highest probabilities of tropical-storm-force winds are concentrated in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, particularly along the coast. The question asks which port is likely to experience gale-force winds *first*. This implies looking at the leading edge of the wind field relative to the storm's movement. Given the storm is approaching the coast of Alabama/Mississippi, ports along that immediate coastline would be affected first.

However, none of the provided options are directly on the immediate coast of Alabama or Mississippi where the highest probabilities are concentrated. Let's re-examine the options in relation to the storm's general direction of movement which appears to be towards the northwest.

Reconsidering the options:
- Tampa, FL is on the opposite coast and too far south.
- Houston, TX is too far west.
- Port of Brunswick, GA is too far northeast.
- Port Everglades, FL is too far southeast.

There seems to be a misunderstanding or error in the provided options relative to the visual data presented in the graphic. The graphic clearly shows the highest probabilities of tropical storm force winds impacting the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama, and extending into the Florida panhandle.

Let me re-interpret the question. It asks which port is *likely* to experience gale-force winds *first*. The storm is moving northwest. This means the areas to the *northwest* of the current position would be impacted first, followed by areas directly north and then northeast, with the lowest impact to the south and west.

Given the options, and the projected northwest movement, the ports that are geographically positioned to be impacted earliest by the storm's wind field, considering its progression, would be those closest to the current storm center and in its path. However, none of the options are ideally located.

Let's assume there's a ""best fit"" among the given choices. If the storm continues its northwestward track, the wind field will expand. Looking at the probabilities, the coastal areas of Mississippi and Alabama have the highest probabilities (>90% in purple). The Florida panhandle also has high probabilities.

Let's consider the timing. The forecast is for 120 hours (5 days) from 7 AM CDT Mon Sep 14 to 7 AM CDT Sat Sep 19. The storm center is shown at 7 AM CDT Mon Sep 14.

Let's assume a typical northwestward movement for a Gulf Coast storm. Ports in Mississippi and Alabama would be impacted first. Since those are not options, we look for the closest option that aligns with the storm's movement.

Let's re-evaluate the options based on general geographic location relative to the storm's starting point and projected path:
- Port Everglades, FL (D) is on the southeast coast of Florida. The storm is moving away from this area.
- Tampa Port Authority, FL (A) is on the west coast of Florida. The storm's path is to the northwest, so it would likely impact this area later, if at all.
- Houston Port Authority, TX (B) is to the west of the projected path.
- Port of Brunswick, GA (C) is to the northeast.

This is problematic as the graphic clearly indicates the highest probability of winds is along the Mississippi and Alabama coasts. None of the options are located there. There might be an issue with the question or the provided choices.

However, if we are forced to choose the *most appropriate* choice, we need to infer which of these ports *might* be affected earliest by the *outflow* or *broadening* of the wind field as it moves inland, assuming a northwestward trajectory. Given the proximity of the storm to the Florida panhandle (though not an option), and its general movement, the western coast of Florida (Tampa) might be affected by some outer bands or the expanding wind field before other options like Houston or Brunswick, though it's still unlikely to be the *first* if the storm tracks as projected.

Let's reconsider the wind field. The green band (10-20% probability) extends significantly to the east and south. The yellow (30-40%) and orange (40-50%) bands also extend somewhat southeast.
The storm is moving northwest. This means areas to the northwest will be affected first. If we look at the ""leading edge"" of the wind probabilities in the direction of travel, it's not immediately clear which of these distant ports would be affected first.

Let me assume there is a typo in the question or options, and consider the general direction. If the storm is heading northwest towards Mississippi/Alabama, the wind field will expand in all directions.
Let's look at the geographic spread of the 5% probability (light green). It extends quite far.

Let's assume the question is flawed and try to find the option that is geographically closest to the projected path of the storm, and could potentially be affected by the outer bands if the storm tracks slightly differently or broadens significantly.

Given the storm's location and projected path, it's difficult to definitively select an option that would experience gale-force winds *first* among the choices provided, as the most likely areas are along the MS/AL coast.

However, if forced to choose, and considering the storm's potential expansion and movement:
- The storm is currently west of Florida.
- It is moving northwest.
- Tampa (A) is on the west coast of Florida.
- Port Everglades (D) is on the southeast coast of Florida.

If the storm's track were to curve more east, Tampa could be affected. If it were to curve more east and then north, some parts of Florida's west coast might see winds before the Texas coast.

Let me look at the image very closely again. The storm center is indicated with a white circle. It is positioned in the Gulf of Mexico, south of Mississippi and Alabama. The colored rings show probabilities of tropical storm force winds.

The question is asking which port is likely to experience gale-force winds *first*. This means we are looking for the port that the storm's wind field will reach first, based on its movement and the expansion of its winds.

Given the storm's current position and its projected northwest movement towards the coast of Mississippi and Alabama, the wind field will likely impact those areas first. Since these are not options, I must reconsider how the wind field expands relative to the options.

Let's consider the ""leading edge"" of the wind field in the general direction of the storm's movement. The storm is moving roughly northwest. Therefore, areas to the northwest of the storm's center are likely to be impacted first.

Let's assume the storm continues its northwestward path and its wind field expands.
- Tampa, FL (A) is to the southeast of the projected path.
- Houston, TX (B) is to the west of the projected path.
- Port of Brunswick, GA (C) is to the northeast of the projected path.
- Port Everglades, FL (D) is to the southeast of the projected path.

This question is problematic with the given options. However, let's consider which of these ports are most likely to encounter the *outer edges* of the wind field *earliest* as the storm progresses.

If the storm maintains a northwest track, the wind field will move in that direction. The probabilities are highest near the center. As the storm moves, the areas to its northwest will be affected first.
Looking at the spread of probabilities:
- The green band (10-20%) extends significantly in all directions.
- The yellow band (30-40%) extends more to the north and west.
- The orange band (40-50%) is more concentrated.

Let's consider the ""first"" impact from the *outer edges* of the wind field.
If the storm moves northwest, the ""leading edge"" of the wind field would be in the northwest. However, all the options are to the south, east, or west, not primarily northwest.

Let me assume there's a subtle nuance I'm missing or an interpretation of ""first"" in the context of the broadest impact.

Let's revisit the options and their relative positions to the storm's projected path. The storm is in the Gulf of Mexico, and its center is roughly between 25-30 degrees North latitude and 90-95 degrees West longitude.

Consider Tampa, FL. It's on the west coast of Florida, around 28 degrees North latitude and 82 degrees West longitude.
Consider Houston, TX. It's further west, around 30 degrees North latitude and 95 degrees West longitude.
Consider Port of Brunswick, GA. It's further north and east, around 31 degrees North latitude and 81 degrees West longitude.
Consider Port Everglades, FL. It's further south, around 26 degrees North latitude and 80 degrees West longitude.

The storm is forecast to move northwest. This means it will move towards the coast of Alabama and Mississippi.
Of the given options, Houston, TX is the furthest west, and thus potentially in the path of the storm's westward expansion if it were to curve that way. However, the primary projection is northwest.

Let me consider the possibility of the storm's outer bands. The 5% probability band (lightest green) extends the furthest.
Let's look at the northern extent of the 5% band. It reaches into Arkansas and Tennessee.
Let's look at the eastern extent. It reaches into Georgia and South Carolina.
Let's look at the western extent. It reaches into eastern Texas.

The question is ""likely to experience gale-force winds *first*"".

Given the storm's movement is generally northwest, the wind field will propagate in that direction. Therefore, areas northwest of the current position will be affected first.

Let's re-examine the options:
A. Tampa Port Authority, FL: Southeast of the storm's path.
B. Houston Port Authority, TX: West of the storm's path.
C. Port of Brunswick, GA: Northeast of the storm's path.
D. Port Everglades, FL: Southeast of the storm's path.

This is a very difficult question with these options. However, if we consider the *broadest* sense of the wind field's propagation, and the storm's general northwest movement, the western edges of the wind field might reach areas further west *earlier* than areas further east or south that are more directly in the path but might be impacted by a more intense core later.

Let's consider the possibility that the question implies the *initial onset* of gale-force winds, which would come from the outer, weaker part of the wind field.
If the storm is moving northwest, and its wind field expands, the furthest western extent of the wind field might reach western areas before the main impact on the central path.

Let me try to find information on Hurricane Sally's actual track and impact to see if any of these ports were indeed affected first. However, I must answer based solely on the provided graphic and question.

Let's assume the storm's expansion is somewhat symmetrical but also influenced by its movement. As it moves northwest, the western flank of the storm's wind field will be advancing westward.

Considering the options, Houston, TX is the westernmost port listed. While the direct path is not towards Houston, the outward spread of the wind field could potentially reach Houston before the eastern or southern ports, given the storm's general trajectory and the fact that the western side of the storm's wind field will be moving westward.

This is a highly inferential choice due to the lack of perfectly placed options. However, if forced to pick the *most appropriate*, Houston's position to the west of the projected path might be reached by the advancing outer bands of tropical storm-force winds earliest amongst the choices.

Final consideration: The storm is moving generally northwest. This means the wind field is also propagating northwest. This suggests that areas to the northwest would be impacted first. Among the given options, none are directly northwest. However, the wind field expands in all directions. If the storm is moving northwest, then its westward extent is also moving westward. Therefore, the westernmost port among the options might be reached by the outer wind field earliest.

Let me consider the possibility of a broad sweep. If the storm makes landfall in Mississippi/Alabama and moves inland, its western quadrants will be moving westward, potentially impacting areas like Houston earlier than areas further east like Brunswick, GA or south like Florida ports.

Given the limitations, and trying to make the most logical inference:

The storm's center is currently in the Gulf of Mexico, moving northwest.
The wind field expands outwards.
The ""first"" impact of gale-force winds would likely be from the leading edge of this expanding field.
As the storm moves northwest, its western flank is moving westward.

Of the options provided:
- Tampa and Port Everglades are east/southeast of the storm's path.
- Brunswick is northeast.
- Houston is to the west/northwest of the storm's current position.

Considering the movement and expansion, Houston, TX is the most plausible choice among the given options to experience the onset of gale-force winds first, due to its westward position relative to the storm's general trajectory.
