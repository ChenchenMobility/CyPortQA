However, vessels should continue to monitor weather forecasts and updates from the National Weather Service (NWS) and the US Coast Guard (USCG) for any potential changes in the storm's track or intensity that could affect local conditions.",Vessels wishing to remain in port must request permission from the Captain of the Port and submit a written safe-mooring plan; vessels unable to safely offload and depart within 24 hours before the arrival of threatening winds should seek an alternate port.
"Based on the forecasted track and intensity of Hurricane Ian, it is recommended that ocean-going and commercial vessels operating in or near the Canaveral Port District, FL area take necessary precautions to ensure safe navigation, including altering course to avoid the storm's projected path, reducing speed to minimize wind resistance, and preparing for potential weather-related hazards.
