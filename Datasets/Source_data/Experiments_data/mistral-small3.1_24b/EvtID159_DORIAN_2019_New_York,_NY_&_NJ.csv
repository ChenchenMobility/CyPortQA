"The cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at New York, NY & NJ within the next 5 days can be determined by examining the probabilities listed for relevant locations in New York and New Jersey. The relevant locations are:

- New York City, NY (NYC)
- Newark, NJ (EWR)
- Atlantic City, NJ (ACY)

From the data provided:

- NYC: 34-kt wind probability is 99%.
- EWR: 34-kt wind probability is 99%.
- ACY: 34-kt wind probability is 99%.

Since all relevant locations have a 99% probability of 34-kt wind arrival within the next 5 days, the cumulative probability for the region can be considered as 99%.

So, the answer is 99.",6%
