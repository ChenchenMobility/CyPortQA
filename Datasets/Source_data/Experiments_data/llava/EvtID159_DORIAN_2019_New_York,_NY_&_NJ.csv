"Based on the information provided and assuming that all commercial vessels in the affected area will be affected during the entire event, a rough estimate of the total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at New York, NY & NJ can be made:

* 130 mi (210 km) from Charleston SC to Pamlico Sound: approximately 5 days \* 30.61606328 vessels/day \* 70% of the time (assuming that the storm is affecting this area for 70% of its duration): 5 \* 30.61606328 \* 0.7 = approximately 92.49 vessels
* Pamlico Sound to North Carolina/Virginia border: approximately 5 days \* 30.61606328 vessels/day \* 70% of the time (assuming that the storm is affecting this area for 70% of its duration): 5 \* 30.61606328 \* 0.7 = approximately 92.49 vessels

The total predicted impacted number of commercial vessels at New York, NY & NJ over the entire event would be approximately 184.99 vessels (rounding to the nearest integer). This is a rough estimate and actual numbers may vary.",D.
