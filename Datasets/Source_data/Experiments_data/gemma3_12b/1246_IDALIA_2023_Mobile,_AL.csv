"The provided text is a weather forecast table. To determine when the probability of 34-kt winds at Mobile, AL rises above zero, we need to look for the earliest time associated with a probability greater than zero for that location.

Given that the data is presented in a table format with limited information regarding time intervals, and no actual numerical data is provided, it's impossible to determine the precise time.

However, based on the structure of the table, it appears that the earliest mentioned locations are those nearest to the Gulf Coast. Given the context, a reasonable guess is that the earliest time for Mobile, AL, is within the first 24 hours.

Therefore, the answer is **B. 0-24 Hours**.",B.

**Explanation:**

The provided text indicates that Mobile, AL is within the area potentially impacted by Tropical Storm Idalia. Specifically, it mentions: ""Indian Pass to Mexico Beach...1 to 3 ft."" and ""Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT. Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT"".
