DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beta was
located near latitude 26.6 North, longitude 92.7 West. Beta is
moving toward the west near 2 mph (3 km/h), and a slow motion toward
the west should continue into Sunday.  A slow northwestward motion
is forecast to begin late Sunday or Sunday night and continue
through late Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Beta will
slowly approach the Texas coast into early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is expected today.  After that,
slow strengthening is forecast, and Beta is expected to be at or
near hurricane strength Sunday night or Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Port Mansfield, TX to Cameron, LA including Baffin Bay, Corpus
Christi Bay, Copano Bay, Aransas Bay, San Antonio Bay, Matagorda
Bay, Galveston Bay, Sabine Lake, and Calcasieu Lake...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Port Mansfield, TX...1-3 ft
Cameron, LA to Ocean Springs, MS including Vermilion Bay...1-3 ft
Lake Maurepas, Lake Pontchartrain, and Lake Borgne...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning area by late Sunday or Sunday night.  Hurricane conditions
are possible within the hurricane watch area by late Monday or
Monday night.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
tropical storm watch area along the southwestern Louisiana coast as
early as tonight, and are possible within the tropical storm watch
area along the south Texas coast Sunday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Beta has the potential to produce a long-lived rainfall
event along the western Gulf Coast. Today through Tuesday, Beta is
expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 3 to 5 inches with
isolated totals of 10 inches beginning Saturday across southern
Louisiana and spreading into coastal Texas on Sunday. Flash and
urban flooding is likely as well as minor river flooding. Additional
heavy rainfall amounts across the western Gulf Coast are possible
through late week as Beta is expected to move slowly near the Texas
coast.
 
SURF:  Swells are expected to increase and reach the coast of Texas
and the Gulf Coast of Mexico later today, generated by a combination
of Beta and a cold front entering the northern Gulf of Mexico.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
