River flooding and potential disruptions to vessel traffic are possible.,Isolated brief tornadoes possible in rainbands; elevated rip-current risk
"Potential hazards include disruption of port operations, navigational hazards from debris, and economic impacts from delays and potential damage.",Isolated tornadoes in outer rainbands and dangerous rip currents along adjacent beaches.
Life-threatening rip currents are possible.,Elevated rip-current risk along the southeast Georgia coast due to distant swells.
Life-threatening rip currents are possible.,Enhanced rip currents along Georgia beaches
,Isolated thunderstorms and brief marine squalls could interrupt vessel movements; elevated rip-current risk along nearby beaches.
,Isolated tornado threat cannot be ruled out in any rainbands that reach coastal Georgia late week.
,Dangerous rip currents and elevated seas along offshore approach channels
,Rough surf and dangerous rip currents likely along the Georgia and South Carolina beaches mid-week.
Rip currents are possible.,Dangerous rip currents and higher than normal waves along Georgia beaches mid-week.
,Minor coastal rip current risk possible mid-week due to distant swells.
