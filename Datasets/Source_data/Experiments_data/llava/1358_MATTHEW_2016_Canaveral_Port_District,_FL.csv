"The image you provided appears to be a screenshot of a weather forecast or map, showing a projected track for a tropical cyclone. However, without access to the current weather data or an accurate representation of the tropical cyclone's path in real-time, I cannot determine the current eye of the cyclone based solely on this image.","31.2N, 80.5W"
"The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot from a weather forecast map showing the projected path of a cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean. However, the image doesn't contain information on the coordinates for the current eye of the tropical cyclone. Typically, the current eye is where the central pressure is lowest and is surrounded by the storm's most intense winds. In such maps, this area would be highlighted with a symbol or color that differentiates it from the surrounding areas.

To provide you with the coordinates for the current eye of the tropical cyclone, I would need to have access to real-time tracking data, which is not available in static images. Additionally, it's important to note that the coordinates of a cyclone can change rapidly as the storm evolves and moves over time.","29.4N, 80.5W"

Please note that this information is based on the most up-to-date data available in the image at the time it was taken, and the actual position may have changed since then due to the dynamic nature of storm tracks.","27.1N, 79.2W"

The cyclone appears to be in the Atlantic Ocean, but without more detailed information or a specific image showing the location, it is not possible for me to give you the exact coordinates. The NHC's track forecast cone provides a general idea of where the storm might make landfall, which typically requires more context and up-to-date data than what is available in the provided image.","23.4N, 76.4W"

The advisory also discusses the possibility of life-threatening inundation along the Florida northeast coast, the Georgia coast, the South Carolina coast, and the North Carolina coast from Sebastian Inlet to Cape Fear, North Carolina. Additional hazards mentioned are tornadoes along the South Carolina, Georgia, and northeast Florida coasts today, and potential life-threatening surf and rip current conditions due to swells generated by the storm.
