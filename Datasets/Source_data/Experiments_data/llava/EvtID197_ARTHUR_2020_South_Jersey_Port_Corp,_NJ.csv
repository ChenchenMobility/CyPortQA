"The 34-kt wind probability does not peak at South Jersey Port Corp, NJ within the next 5 days based on the given data.",15
"The text provided includes a table of probabilities for sustained (1-minute average) winds of at least 34 kt (39 mph... 63 km/h) for various locations in the northeastern United States over the next 5 days, from 06Z SAT to 18Z THU. The table shows the probability of the event beginning during each time period (onset probability) and the cumulative probability of the event occurring between 18Z SAT and the forecast hour for each location.

To answer your question with only a number, you would need to determine which specific location within South Jersey Port Corp, NJ you are referring to, as there may be multiple locations listed under that name in the table provided. Once you have identified the appropriate location, you can find the time period when the probability of sustained winds of at least 34 kt peaks within the next 5 days by examining the cumulative probabilities for each hour from 06Z SAT to 18Z THU.

For example, if you look at the location ""CAPE HATTERAS,"" you can see that the probability of sustained winds of at least 34 kt peaks between 29 (Sunday) and 37 (Monday) hours, with a cumulative probability of 2 during those hours. If you are referring to South Jersey Port Corp, NJ located in Cape May, NJ, the probability of sustained winds of at least 34 kt peaks between 18Z SAT (06Z SAT) and 06Z SUN (18Z SAT), with a cumulative probability of 2.

Therefore, if you are referring to South Jersey Port Corp, NJ located in Cape May, NJ, there are 16 hours remaining until the 34-kt wind probability peaks within the next 5 days (from 06Z SAT to 18Z THU). If you are referring to a different location within South Jersey Port Corp, NJ or a different time period, please provide more information so that I can assist you further.",120

The potential future storm may cause flooding in low-lying areas near the port due to high tides and storm surges.,High surf and rip currents could disrupt vessel movements and port approaches
Possible flooding due to storm surge,Dangerous rip currents and rough seas that may disrupt pilot transfers and lightering operations in Delaware Bay and approaches to Camden/Philadelphia
The potential for increased boat traffic due to the storm.,High surf and dangerous rip currents along the New Jersey shore Monday-Tuesday could disrupt pilot boat operations and berthing.
"The image shows a map with an overlaid cyclone forecast cone for Tropical Storm One, indicating its projected path over the next few days. The forecast suggests that the storm is expected to move offshore but parallel to the coast of North Carolina before reaching the North Carolina coast on Monday. Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area on Monday, and rainfall accumulations of 1 to 2 inches are expected across coastal North Carolina. Swells generated by the depression could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across much of the U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts. The next intermediate advisory will be at 800 PM EDT, and the next complete advisory will be at 1100 PM EDT.",Rough seas and hazardous marine conditions for vessels transiting Delaware Bay and the offshore shipping lanes

"The image depicts a weather forecast from the National Hurricane Center, providing information about Tropical Storm Arthur. It does not contain any specific details about the port's freight or recovery times. However, I can provide general guidance on how to interpret such forecasts:

- The bulletin outlines the characteristics of the storm, including its current position, maximum sustained winds, and expected movement.
- The watches and warnings section indicates which areas are at risk from the tropical storm.
- The discussion and outlook section provides a detailed analysis of the storm's behavior and forecast for future intensification or weakening.
- The hazards affecting land section explains the potential impacts of the storm on coastal areas, such as wind, rainfall, and surf conditions.

Regarding the recovery time for port freight, it would be highly speculative to estimate this without specific information about the port's operations or the anticipated path of Tropical Storm Arthur. Port operations could potentially be affected by the storm, but recovery times are usually determined by the severity of the storm and the extent of damage or disruption to the port's infrastructure.",3.0
