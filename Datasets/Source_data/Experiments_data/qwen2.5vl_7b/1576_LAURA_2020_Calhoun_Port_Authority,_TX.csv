Tsunami and tsunamis are possible in the Gulf of Mexico due to the storm's potential to generate large waves.,Dangerous rip currents and large swells may affect vessel operations and channel pilotage even though the storm core remains well east
Tsunami warning,Dangerous surf and rip currents through Thursday; isolated tornado risk shifts inland well northeast of the port
Large and destructive waves along the immediate coast near and to the right of the landfall location.,"Rough seas, dangerous rip currents, and short-period halts to cargo operations likely Wednesday night through Thursday."
The potential for life-threatening surf and rip current conditions due to swells generated by Laura.,Rough seas and dangerous rip currents in Matagorda Bay and near-shore Gulf waters may disrupt vessel movements.
Tsunami and landslides.,High seas and dangerous rip currents in approaches; possible port access restrictions beginning late Wednesday
Tsunami,High seas and dangerous surf beginning late Tuesday will likely shut down vessel movements; potential for minor coastal flooding during high tide.
"Swells generated by Laura are affecting portions of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, eastern Cuba, the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.",Very rough seas and higher-than-normal tides could halt vessel movements and cargo operations
"Swells generated by Laura are expected to affect the area, posing a risk to marine operations.",None anticipated beyond minor marine/sea-state deterioration along the middle Texas coast.
"Swells generated by Laura are expected to affect the northern coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Cuba, and much of the Bahamas.",Elevated seas and minor coastal flooding could disrupt vessel movements even if direct storm impacts remain east of the port
"Swells generated by Laura are expected to affect the northern coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Cuba, and much of the Bahamas.",None
