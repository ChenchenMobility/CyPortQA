DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine was
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 79.8 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h),
and this general motion should continue over the next few days.  On
the forecast track, the center of the depression will pass near or
over the Cayman Islands tonight, the Isle of Youth and western Cuba
Friday, and over the southeastern and central Gulf of Mexico Friday
night and Saturday.  The system is forecast to approach the U.S.
northern Gulf coast on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Steady strengthening is forecast during the next few days.  The
depression is expected to become a tropical storm tonight, and
become a hurricane when it is near western Cuba or over the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico.  Additional strengthening is likely
over the Gulf of Mexico, and the system could be near major
hurricane strength when it approaches the northern Gulf coast.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure from Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance data is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).

Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore
winds along the immediate coast of the Isle of Youth and near and to
the east of where the center crosses the coast of western Cuba.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Cayman
Islands tonight, and are expected to reach the Isle of Youth and
portions of western Cuba in the warning area on Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  The depression is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 6 to 10 inches with maximum totals of 15 inches
across Jamaica.  Rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches with isolated
maximum amounts of 20 inches are expected across the Cayman Islands
and western Cuba, including the Isle of Youth. These rainfall
amounts may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.
 
The depression may begin to bring rainfall and potential flooding
impacts to the central Gulf Coast by early Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by this system will begin affect Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands and Cuba tonight and Friday. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
