However, it does mention that the storm is forecast to pass near the Cayman Islands and approach the northeastern portion of the Yucatan peninsula, where it could impact various coastal areas with tropical-storm-force winds, heavy rainfall, and potential storm surge.

It's important to note that storm tracks and intensities can change over time, so any forecast regarding the duration or extent of impacts on the port's freight would depend on the most up-to-date information from the NHC or other meteorological agencies. If you have a specific concern about how the storm might impact cargo operations at a particular port, I recommend checking the official website of the relevant port authority for any updates or advisories related to Hurricane Delta and its potential impacts on the port's operations.",2
"The port's freight is expected to be affected by the storm for at least 5 days, as it will take time for the storm to pass and for normal operations to resume. However, it is possible that the storm could have lasting effects on the port, which would require additional assessment and response efforts.",2
The document does not provide information on the duration of the impact of the storm on the port's freight.,2
"The image shows a satellite view of Hurricane Delta, which is a powerful storm system that is currently affecting parts of the United States Gulf Coast region. It indicates that the storm is moving towards land and has sustained winds of around 120 mph (195 km/h). The National Weather Service has issued a warning for the storm surge and the potential for other dangerous conditions, advising people to take necessary actions to protect life and property. The port's freight may be affected by this storm, but without more context or information, it is not possible to determine how many days it will take for the port's freight to recover.",1.0

"It is not possible to predict the exact number of days it will take for freight operations at a port to fully recover from the impact of Hurricane Delta. The recovery time can depend on several factors, including the extent of damage, the availability of resources, and the effectiveness of response efforts.",1.0

"The text you provided is a forecast bulletin from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) about a tropical disturbance named Potential Tropical Cyclone Twenty-Six, which has the potential to form into a hurricane over the next few days.

The forecast indicates that the system will pass just south of Jamaica tonight and early Monday, move near or over the Cayman Islands Monday night, and approach the Isle of Youth and western Cuba Tuesday afternoon or evening. It is expected to move into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico Tuesday night or early Wednesday.

The current forecast shows maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h), with higher gusts. The system is expected to become a tropical storm when it nears the Cayman Islands on Monday, and a hurricane when it moves near or over western Cuba on Tuesday. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

The storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of the Isle of Youth and along the south coast of western Cuba near and to right of where the center makes landfall. There is a potential for 3 to 5 inches of rain with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches across Jamaica, southern Haiti, and western Cuba, which could lead to life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands beginning late Monday, and hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area by Tuesday afternoon.

The next complete advisory is expected at 1100 PM EDT (0000 UTC), and it will be updated as needed.",1.0
