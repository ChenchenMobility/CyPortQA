"Flash, urban, small stream, and isolated river flooding impacts.",Isolated tornado risk cannot be ruled out inland; potential river/urban flooding impacts port operations
Tornadoes are possible.,Low-end risk of isolated brief tornadoes inland if remnants track nearby; possible minor river rises but no significant flooding forecast.
"Tornadoes may be possible near Wilmington, DE.",Localized river or urban flooding from persistent rain bands
Tornadoes are possible as the storm interacts with a front in the area.,None
Tornadoes may be possible as the storm interacts with a front in the area.,Urban and small-stream flooding could disrupt terminal trucking and rail access
There is a risk of isolated tornadoes.,Very low tornado risk associated with remnant frontal interaction
Heavy rain and flood impacts could extend into inland portions of the Southeast and into the southern and central Appalachians and Piedmont as Fred interacts with a front in the area.,"Minor river/urban ponding possible if localized downpours occur, but no significant marine or port operational hazards anticipated"
"Swells generated by the storm could affect coastal areas, leading to dangerous surf and rip current conditions.",Up-river flooding on Delaware River could be aggravated if heavy upstream rainfall occurs; supply-chain delays likely from Gulf-coast impacts.
"Swells generated by the storm could affect coastal areas, leading to dangerous surf and rip current conditions.",None anticipated
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.,None
