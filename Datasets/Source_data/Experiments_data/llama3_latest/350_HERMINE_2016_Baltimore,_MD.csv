"A very specific and detailed question!

After analyzing the forecast, I found that the system (Tropical Depression Nine) is expected to move northward, away from Florida, and into the Atlantic Ocean. As it does so, its impacts will gradually diminish.

According to the latest advisory, it's likely that the system's effects on freight at Baltimore, MD will subside by around **04-08 September**.

Please note that this is an estimate based on the current forecast, and actual circumstances may vary.",None
