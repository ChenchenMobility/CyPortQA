"Based on the information provided, it seems that the impact of the potential tropical cyclone on commercial vessels at Port of Brunswick, GA is not explicitly stated. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the weather conditions and the location.

The storm surge warning is in effect for Indian Pass FL to Clearwater Beach FL, which does not directly affect Port of Brunswick, GA. However, the tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from the center of the disturbance, which means that the port could potentially experience strong winds and rough seas.

Given the location and weather conditions, it's likely that the impact on commercial vessels at Port of Brunswick, GA would be significant. However, without specific information about the number of vessels affected or the duration of the disruption, we can only make an educated estimate.

Based on the average daily number of vessels (3.047155461), I would choose:

D. 20 vessels or more",B.
The correct answer is B. 1-10 vessels.,B.
