over the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of
Isaias will move near the Southeastern Bahamas by late tonight.
Isaias is forecast to be near the Central Bahamas Friday night and
move near or over the Northwestern Bahamas and near South Florida on
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next day or so, and
Isaias is forecast to become a hurricane on Friday or Friday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Isaias can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC, and
on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by as
much as 3 to 5 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore
flow in the central and northwest Bahamas.  Storm surge will raise
water level by as much as 1 to 3 ft above normal tide levels in the
southeastern Bahamas.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread across
portions of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the southeastern Bahamas
and Turks and Caicos within the warning area tonight. Tropical storm
conditions are expected to begin in the central Bahamas Friday
morning and spread into the northwestern Bahamas beginning late
Friday.  Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the
the northwestern Bahamas Friday night and Saturday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in Florida
beginning Saturday.
 
RAINFALL: Isaias is expected to produce the following rain
accumulations:
 
Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and northern Haiti: 4 to 8 inches,
with isolated maximum totals of 12 inches.
 
Bahamas, Turks and Caicos: 4 to 8 inches.
 
Cuba: 1 to 2 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 4 inches.
 
These rainfall amounts will lead to life-threatening flash flooding
and mudslides, as well as river flooding.  Urban and small stream
flooding is expected for the U.S. Virgin Islands, eastern and
southwestern Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola.
 
Heavy rains associated with Isaias may begin to affect eastern
Florida over the weekend.  This rain could result in isolated flash
and urban flooding, especially in low-lying and poorly drained
areas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaias are affecting portions of
the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican
Republic, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern
Bahamas. These swells will spread along the coast of Cuba and into
the central and northwestern Bahamas over the next day or two.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
