DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fay was 
located near latitude 35.5 North, longitude 74.9 West. Fay is moving 
toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A northward to north- 
northeastward motion at a faster forward speed is expected over the 
next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Fay is 
forecast to move near the mid-Atlantic coast on Friday, and move 
inland over the northeast United States on Saturday. 
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Some slight strengthening is forecast tonight and 
Friday.  Weakening should begin after the center moves inland on 
Saturday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
primarily to the east and southeast of the center. 
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by reconnaissance 
aircraft is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
