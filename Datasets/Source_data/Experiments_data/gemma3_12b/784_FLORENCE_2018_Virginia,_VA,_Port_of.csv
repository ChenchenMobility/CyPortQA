"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Reasoning:**

The advisory highlights ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"" impacting the U.S. East Coast, including Virginia. Given the severity of the storm (hurricane with potential for significant storm surge and rainfall), port operations would likely be suspended or severely restricted. This would mean commercial vessels would be delayed, diverted, or seeking safe harbor elsewhere. A prolonged disruption of this magnitude, affecting a port with a daily average of nearly 18 vessels, strongly suggests an impact exceeding 20 vessels over the duration of the event.",D.
B. 1-10 vessels,D.
,D.
,D.
"Based on the advisory, the hurricane warning area extends to the North Carolina-Virginia border. The advisory mentions ""A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect from north of Duck North Carolina to the North Carolina-Virginia border."" While it doesn't give a specific number of vessels affected, the mention of a tropical storm warning extending to Virginia suggests *some* impact is likely. Given the average daily vessel count of 17.58, a significant disruption warrants more than a few vessels being affected. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is:

**C. 10-20 vessels**



**Important Note:** This is an educated guess based solely on the provided text. A real assessment would require significantly more data.",D.
,D.
"D. 20 vessels or more.



**Reasoning:**

The advisory explicitly mentions ""Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by late Thursday or Thursday night."" Given the potential for significant disruption due to hurricane-force winds and storm surge, it's highly likely that commercial vessel operations at the Port of Virginia would be suspended or severely curtailed. A port closure would affect many vessels and 20 vessels or more is a reasonable estimate.",D.
"Based on the provided text, there's no mention of specific commercial vessel impacts at the Port of Virginia. The advisory discusses swells affecting Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, and mentions potential watches and warnings for the southeastern and mid-Atlantic states. However, it doesn't quantify the number of vessels expected to be impacted.

"Based on the advisory, Hurricane Florence is predicted to approach the southeastern coast of the United States on Thursday. The advisory doesn't specify any direct impacts or evacuation orders for the Port of Virginia. Given the general path and lack of specific warnings, it's unlikely to cause a dramatic disruption. Therefore, the most reasonable estimate is a minimal impact.
