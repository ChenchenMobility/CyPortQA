Explanation: In the given image, at 0 UTC on September 8th, Hurricane Irma is a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h). However, the gale force probability for this time does not indicate any high winds expected within the next 12 hours. The gale force probability becomes ""ON"" at 48 hours, indicating that there is a possibility of strong winds in the future. At 72 hours, it remains ""ON"", suggesting that the strong winds may continue for another day. However, at 96 hours, the gale force probability is set to ""OFF"", implying that the strong winds are no longer expected after this time period.","{'in 12h': '0%', 'in 24h': '0%', 'in 48h': '13%', 'in 72h': '66%', 'in 96h': '11%'}"
