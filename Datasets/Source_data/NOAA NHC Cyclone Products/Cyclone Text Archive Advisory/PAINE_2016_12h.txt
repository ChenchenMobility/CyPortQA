DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Paine was
located near latitude 26.1 North, longitude 117.0 West.  Paine is
moving toward the north near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue today.  A turn toward the north-northeast and
a decrease in forward speed are forecast tonight.  On the forecast
track, the center of Paine will approach the northwestern coast of
the Baja California peninsula tonight and early Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Paine is
expected to weaken to a tropical depression by tonight, become a
remnant low early Wednesday, and dissipate by early Thursday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Paine is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
inches across the northern Baja California peninsula with isolated
storm total amounts of 6 inches through Wednesday.

Moisture in advance of Paine will help spread rain into portions of
southern California, Arizona, southern Utah, New Mexico, and
southwestern Colorado with localized maximum amounts of 1 to 2
inches possible, mainly in areas of favored higher terrain.

WIND:  Wind gusts to near tropical storm force are possible along
portions of the northwest coast of the Baja California peninsula
through tonight.
