near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 70.3 West. Elsa is moving very
quickly toward the west-northwest near 31 mph (50 km/h).  A decrease
in forward speed is expected later today and Sunday, followed by a
turn toward the northwest Sunday night or Monday. On the forecast

today and tonight, and move near Jamaica and portions of eastern
Cuba on Sunday.  By Monday, Elsa is expected to move across central
and western Cuba and head toward the Florida Straits.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected today, but slow 
weakening is forecast on Sunday and Monday when Elsa is expected to 
be near or over Cuba.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).

RAINFALL: The outer rain bands associated with Elsa will impact
Puerto Rico today with rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with
localized amounts of 5 inches possible. This rain may lead to
isolated flash flooding, minor river flooding, and mudslides.
 
Across portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica, rainfall of 4 to
8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches is expected
Saturday into Sunday.  This rain may lead to scattered flash
flooding and mudslides.
 
Across portions of the Cayman Islands and Cuba Sunday into Monday,
rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 15
inches is expected. This will result in significant flash flooding
with mudslides in Cuba.
 
Rainfall from Elsa is likely to impact portions of the Florida Keys
and southern Florida early next week. Amounts of 2 to 4 inches with
localized maximum amounts up to 6 inches will be possible, which may
result in isolated flash, urban, and minor river flooding.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Elsa will spread westward across the
Caribbean Sea through the weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
