DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Twenty-Two was located near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 93.9
West. The depression is moving toward the north-northeast near 7 mph
(11 km/h), and this general motion is expected through early
Saturday. A slow westward motion is forecast to begin late Saturday 
or Saturday night, and this motion will likely continue into early 
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and the
depression is expected to become a tropical storm later today. The
system could be near or at hurricane strength by Sunday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells are expected to increase and reach the coast of Texas
and the Gulf Coast of Mexico over the weekend, generated by a 
combination of the depression and a cold front entering the
northern Gulf of Mexico.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
