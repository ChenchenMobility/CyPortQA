DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fred was
located near latitude 26.8 North, longitude 85.3 West. Fred is
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this
motion should continue through tonight.  A turn toward the north is
expected on Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fred
should move across the eastern and northern Gulf of Mexico through
Monday, then make landfall in the western Florida Panhandle Monday
afternoon or Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected until landfall.  After 
landfall, Fred is expected to quickly weaken.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
mainly to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fred can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC and
on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?key_messages.
 
RAINFALL: Fred is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:
 
Through Monday...
 
Keys and southern Florida... 3 to 5 inches.
 
Through Tuesday...
 
The Florida Big Bend and Panhandle... 4 to 8 inches with isolated
maximum storm totals of 12 inches.
 
Southeast Alabama through western and northern Georgia, and the
western Carolinas... 3 to 6 inches with isolated maximum storm
totals of 9 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall across portions of Florida, southern Alabama,
portions of Georgia, and the western Carolinas could lead to flash,
urban, small stream and isolated river flooding impacts.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Indian Pass, FL to Steinhatchee River, FL...3-5 ft
Steinhatchee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...2-4 ft
AL/FL border to Indian Pass including Pensacola Bay, Choctawhatchee
Bay and Saint Andrew Bay... 1-3 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Aripeka, FL...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning area beginning on Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fred are expected to reach the coasts of
Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle on Monday, and could
causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office for more details.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two are possible this afternoon into early
Monday along the west coast of Florida and over the Florida
Panhandle.
