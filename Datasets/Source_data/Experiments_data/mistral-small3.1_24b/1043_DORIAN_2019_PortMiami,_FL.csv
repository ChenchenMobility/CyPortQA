"PortMiami, FL was not included in the table. However, since the probabilities for locations are given in the table are ordered from highest to lowest, and OCEANA NAS VA, ELIZABETH CTY, and CAPE HATTERAS all have 99% probabilities in the 0-12 hour range, it is reasonable to infer that the highest 34-kt wind probability for PortMiami would also likely be in the 0-12 hour range if it were included.
