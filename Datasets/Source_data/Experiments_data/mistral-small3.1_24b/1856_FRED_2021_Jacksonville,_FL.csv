"Based on the provided information, the port of interest is not specified. However, the storm is expected to impact the Florida Keys and southern Florida starting around Saturday. Given the typical recovery time for ports after a tropical storm, which can range from a few days to a week depending on the severity of the impact, we can estimate the recovery time.

The storm is expected to affect the area for approximately 1-2 days. Assuming moderate impact and standard recovery procedures, the port's freight operations might recover within 3 days after the storm passes.

Since the storm is expected to affect the area starting around Saturday, and assuming it takes 3 days for the port to recover, the total number of days for the port's freight to recover would be:

2 (days of storm impact) + 3 (days of recovery) = 5 days

Answer: 5",None
"Based on the provided information, the port of Miami is expected to experience tropical-storm-force winds starting around 00Z Saturday (August 14, 2021) with a cumulative probability of 9%. The winds are expected to persist until 00Z Monday (August 16, 2021) with a cumulative probability of 11%. Given that tropical-storm-force winds can cause disruptions to port operations, and considering the typical time it takes for ports to recover from such events, it is reasonable to estimate that the port's freight operations could take 2 days to fully recover.",None
