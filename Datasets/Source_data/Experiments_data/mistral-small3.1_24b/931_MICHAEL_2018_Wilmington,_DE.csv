"Based on the provided advisory, tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area by this evening or tonight. Michael is forecasted to move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico late Monday through Wednesday morning. Considering the typical forward speed of tropical storms and their potential to affect areas along the U.S. East Coast, Wilmington, DE, could start experiencing tropical storm conditions approximately 72 hours after the advisory time (1800 UTC Sun Oct 07 2018). This estimate takes into account the expected track, intensification, and forward speed of the system. However, it is essential to monitor updates from the National Hurricane Center for more precise information.
