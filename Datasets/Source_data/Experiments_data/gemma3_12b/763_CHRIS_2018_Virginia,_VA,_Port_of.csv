"Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

*   **The Event:** The text refers to Tropical Depression Three and its potential impact. The advisory indicates the depression will remain ""offshore"" of the North Carolina and Virginia coasts.
*   **Virginia's Port:** The text doesn't explicitly mention disruptions to the Port of Virginia. It focuses on the storm's track and general hazards. The storm is expected to remain offshore.
*   **Commercial Vessel Count:** The prompt provides the average daily number of commercial vessels (17.58411926).
*   **Considering the information:** Since the storm is predicted to remain offshore and no specific disruptions are mentioned, the most reasonable assumption is that there would be minimal to no direct impact on the port.

Therefore, the answer is **A. None**.",A.
