"The image does not depict any additional hazards besides rainfall, wind, and storm surge for the possible future storm at Kansas City Port Authority, MO.","Brief river level rises on the Missouri River could delay barge operations, but no major flooding currently anticipated"

Flooding from nearby rivers and streams due to heavy rainfall.,"Prolonged rains could elevate Missouri and Mississippi River levels, affecting barge traffic; isolated short-lived tornadoes cannot be ruled out south and east of the port"
"Additional hazards associated with a possible future storm at Kansas City Port Authority, MO, excluding rainfall, wind, and storm surge include disruptions to port operations and cargo transportation due to high winds, potential damage to infrastructure, and potential delays in shipments.",Potential river/flash flooding on tributar­ies feeding the Missouri River which could disrupt barge schedules and river levels near the port
"Additional hazards could include potential disruptions to port operations due to weather-related closures or delays, as well as increased demand for resources like fuel and bottled water in anticipation of the storm's impact.","Growing risk of river and flash flooding on already-elevated Missouri River and tributaries, which could disrupt barge traffic and wharf operations even without direct wind impacts"
