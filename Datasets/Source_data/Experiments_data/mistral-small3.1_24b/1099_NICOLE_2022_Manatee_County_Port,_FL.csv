"The cumulative probability of 34-kt wind arrival at Manatee County Port, FL within the next 5 days is not directly provided in the data. However, we can infer it from the nearby locations. The closest relevant data points are for TAMPA FL and SARASOTA FL.

TAMPA FL:
- 34-kt wind arrival probabilities: 15% (15+25+13)/100 = 53%

SARASOTA FL:
- 34-kt wind arrival probabilities:  (13+12+7)/100 = 32%

Given that Manatee County Port is located between Tampa and Sarasota, we can estimate the probability by averaging these two values.

(53% + 32%) / 2 = 42.5%

So, the estimated cumulative probability is approximately 42.5%. Since you need a number only:

"The data for Manatee County Port, FL is not provided in the given text. However, based on the format and similar locations listed, we can infer that the relevant location might be ""BRADENTON FL"" is the closest representative for Manatee County Port, FL.

For Bradenton FL:
- 0-12 hours: X
- 12-24 Hours: X
- 24-48 hours: 32
- 48 hours or more: 9

So the highest 34-kt wind probability is in interval C. 24-48 hours.",D.
"To determine the highest 34-kt wind probability for Manatee County Port, FL, we need to locate the relevant data in the provided forecast. Manatee County Port, FL, is not explicitly listed, but we can infer the closest relevant location from the given data. ""TAMPA FL"" is a reasonable proxy since Manatee County is near Tampa.

Here are the probabilities for ""TAMPA FL"" at 34-kt winds:
- 0-12 hours: X (0%)
- 12-24 hours: X (0%)
- 24-48 hours: 40 (40%)
- 48 hours or more: 6 (6%)

Based on these values, the highest probability is in the 24-48 hours interval.

Therefore, the answer is:
